                                                      Eighth Draft

                                                  January 21, 1999






<b>        FADE IN:
</b>
        Very happy, Disneyesque MUSIC swirls in.

        PAN DOWN from a pretty blue sky, to a small quaint town
        nestled in the hills. A wooden sign tells us this is South
        Park.

<b>        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY
</b>
        Birds fly into the air, TOWNSPEOPLE smile to each other as
        they walk by.

        It is a scene reminiscent of, if not directly ripped off
        from, the opening number of 'Beauty and the Beast'.

        A little eight year old boy walks happily down the street. He
        is STAN MARSH, a noble looking boy with piercing blue eyes
        and a strong chin. As he walks, he sings a happy song.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   <b>I'm going to the movies
                   To see the brighter side of life!
                   I'm going to the movie
                   Everything's gonna be alright!
                   Forget all my troubles
                   Put my own life on hold
                   Let a studio tell me
                   how I should view the world
                   Where everything works out
                   I love it that way
                   I'm going to the movies
                   The movies today!</b>

        Stan merrily walks up to a crappy looking house.

<b>        INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
        We are in a young boy's bedroom, just as his alarm clock goes
        off. BRRRRRTTT!!!

<b>                             RADIO ANNOUNCER
</b>                   Good morning South Park! It's five-thirty
                   a.m. on Sunday!! Time to feed the horses
                   and water the cows!!

        From the back, we see the blond haired kid sit up from his
        bed. He stretches, and then walks over to his closet.

        We still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his
        closet and pulls out an orange coat.

        The kid puts his coat on, then turns to camera and pulls the
        hood shut, so that we never get a good look at his face.

<b>                             MOTHER (O.S.)
</b><b>                   KENNY! YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH!!!
</b>
        This boy's name is KENNY, and under his orange coat, we have
        no idea what he looks like, except for his European nose and
        hazel eyes.

<b>                             KENNY
</b>                   Mph rmph rm!

<b>        INT. KENNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN
</b>
        Kenny walks through his small, dirty house and into the
        kitchen, where his MOTHER, FATHER and OLDER BROTHER are
        sitting at the humble table.

<b>                             KENNY'S MOTHER
</b>                   Sit down, you can share some of your
                   brother's waffle.

        The doorbell rings. Kenny walks over to the door.

<b>        EXT. KENNY'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
        Kenny opens the door to find Stan.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Kenny! The Terrance and Phillip movie is
                   out! You wanna come?!

        Stan shows Kenny a newspaper clipping. It's an ad for the new
        Terrance and Phillip movie 'Asses of fire'. Kenny's eyes
        light up.

<b>                             KENNY
</b>                   Mph rmph rm, rmph!

        Kenny walks away with Stan. His mother comes out after him.

<b>                             KENNY'S MOTHER
</b>                   Kenny! Where're you going?

<b>                             KENNY
</b>                   Mph mprh mprh rm!

<b>                             KENNY'S MOTHER
</b>                   What do you mean you don't want to go to
                   church?

<b>                             KENNY
</b>                   Mrmph, rmph rmph rm rmph.

        Kenny and Stan walk down the street.

<b>                             KENNY'S MOTHER
</b>                   Well fine, go ahead and miss church!! And
                   then when you die and go to hell you can
                   <u>ANSWER TO SATAN!!</u>

        Dramatic MUSIC STING. Kenny stops, thinks for a minute... And
        then walks off with Stan anyway.

<b>        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY
</b>
        Stan and Kenny now both happily march down the street to the
        happy beat.

        TOM, a plastic surgeon, peeps his head out the door of his
        Rhinoplasty office.

<b>                             TOM
</b>                   Say, where are you boys going?

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   <b>We're going to the movies!
                   To see the brighter side of life!
                   Where everyone is beautiful
                   And have their hair combed just
                   right!</b>

<b>                             KENNY
</b>                   <b>Mph rmph rm rmph rm!

<b>                             TOM
</b>                   Have fun you rascals!

<b>        EXT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
        Kenny and Stan knock at the door.

        A handsome eight year old Semite, KYLE, answers the door.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go
                   to church, Kenny?

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Kyle, check it out.

        Kenny holds up the newspaper clipping.

<b>                             KYLE
</b><b>                   OH MY GOD, DUDE!!!
</b>
        Kyle slips on his coat and heads out the door. But just then,
        Kyle's little brother, IKE, a two year old adopted Canadian
        boy bounces up next to him.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   No, Ike! You can't come with me!

        Kyle's MOTHER, a big fat bitch, comes to the door and yells.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   Kyle, you take your little brother out to
                   play with you!

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Aw, ma!!

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   Do as I say, Kyle!

        Kyle's mother closes the door.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Damn it!!

<b>        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY
</b>
        Now the three boys, and little Ike, merrily strut down the
        street and sing in unison.

<b>                             BOYS
</b>                   <b>We're going to the movies

<b>                             KYLE

</b>                   <b>We can even make believe marriages

        A HOMELESS guy is lying in the alley.

<b>                             HOMELESS GUY
</b>                   Spare a dollar? Spare a dollar?

        Stan walks by and throws a dollar at him. The homeless guy
        suddenly jumps up.

<b>                             HOMELESS GUY

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Let's go get fat ass!

<b>        EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE - DAY
</b>
        This house looks just like all the others.

<b>        INT. THAT SAME HOUSE
</b>
        CLOSE UP on a bag that reads 'CHEESY POOFS'. A hand reaches
        into the bag, pulls out a wad of orange crunchies and raises
        them --

        BOOM UP to reveal the fat face of eight year old ERIC CARTMAN
        who chows down on the chips.

        Now we see that fat little Eric is sitting on his couch,
        eating Cheesy Poofs and watching television.

        The doorbell rings. Cartman doesn't move a muscle.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b><b>                   MOM! SOMEBODY'S AT THE DOOR!

        CARTMAN'S MOTHER enters. She is extremely June Cleaveresque
        (except that she's a hermaphrodite crack whore). She returns
        with Stan, Kyle and Kenny.

        Now all four boys are merrily walking down the street and
        singing.

        The movie theatre is nestled neatly between two other South
        Park buildings.

        The boys walk up to the geeky, teenage TICKET GUY.

        Suddenly, all the happy music that has permeated the film
        comes to an ABRUPT HALT.

        The boys look confused.

        The old Homeless guy from the intro song walks up to the
        Ticket Guy with the boys.

        The boys are all sitting in the front row. Cartman has a huge

</b>                   Say Terrance, what did the Spanish Priest

        PAN OVER to TERRANCE, who is also Canadian, and equally
        handsome in a more rugged way.

<b>                             TERRANCE
</b>                   I don't know, Phillip, what?

        Phillip rips a big fart. Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

        TRACK IN on the boys' wide eyed faces as the dialogue from
        the film enters their innocent ears.

<b>                             TERRANCE
</b>                   It's from your mother.

<b>                             TERRANCE

        The boys don't laugh, they just smile widely, they seem busy
        taking it all in.

        The scene is reminiscent of the skating scene from the
        Charlie Brown Christmas special.

        Delicate snowflakes fall, children laugh and skate, and
        joyous music plays.

</b>                        (To another kid)
                   We HAVE to see this movie, dude.

        The other kids nod.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Hey Stan, tell 'em about when Terrance
                   called Phillip a testicle shitting rectal
                   wart! Stan? Stan?

        But Stan is elsewhere, because out on the ice, skating
        gracefully, is little eight year old WENDY TESTABURGER.

        The heavens part, a CHOIR OF ANGELS sing, as Wendy skates
        around and around, performing a series of impossible Triple
        Lutzes, Sowcows and what-have-you-not's.

        All the animals of the forest -- deer, birds, bunnies -- all
        stop to admire her.

        Stan's smile grows wider and wider. Kyle turns to see what
        he's looking at.

<b>                             STAN

                   Saw it in a glance

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that
                   fucking song again.

<b>        ANGLE - WENDY
</b>
        Spinning and soaring in slo-mo.  Effortlessly covering every
        inch of the pond with her ballet maneuvers.

        Stan is slack-jawed.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   <b>I can't stop now

                   So this is why I'm ali-</b>

        Wendy finishes her routine with a triumphant Hamill-camel
        landing right in front of Stan and spraying ice in his face
        and abruptly ending his song.

<b>                             WENDY
</b>                   Hi, Stan!

        Stan vomits profusely all over himself.

<b>                             WENDY
</b>                   Ew! Gross!

        Just then, another kid skates up, spraying more ice in Stan's
        face. His name is GREGORY, and he is a very handsome eight
        year old boy, with golden hair and an open-buttoned shirt. He
        speaks with a rich English accent.

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   Come, Wendy, let us try to jump the hilly
                   brush.

        Stan looks at Gregory.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Who are you, kid?

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's
                   counter-cousin for some time.

<b>                             WENDY
</b>                   Want to skate with us?

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   We've been skating all morning. And
                   laughing and talking of memories past.

        Gregory skates away. Stan looks stunned. Finally, he tries to
        get Wendy's attention.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!

<b>                             WENDY
</b>                   That's nice, Stan.

        Wendy skates after Gregory. Stan looks completely rejected.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new
                   guy?

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   She's not my girlfriend, dude!

        Meanwhile, the schoolkids are all still gathered around
        Cartman.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Yes, I saw the Terrance and Phillip
                   movie. Who wants to touch me?  I said,
                   "Who wants to touch me?!"

        A small boy steps forward and tentatively touches Cartman's
        arm.

<b>                             SMALL BOY
</b>                   Oooooh...

<b>        EXT. SOUTH PARK - TOWN - MORNING
</b>
        Establishing shot of the little town of South Park which
        consists of four buildings. The sun rises in the background.

        It's a brand new day.

<b>        EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY
</b>
        The elementary school is nestled peacefully between two
        mountain peaks.

<b>        INT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY
</b>
        The kids of South Park are all in their seats, singing.

<b>                             KIDS
</b>                   <b>Shut your fucking face,
                   Unclefucka!!
                   You're a shitsucking, cocksucking
                   Unclefucka!!</b>

        The door opens, and suddenly the kids quiet down.

        CLOSE-UP on a hand puppet with a large red hat. It seems to
        be speaking.

<b>                             MR. HAT
</b>                   Okay, children, let's take our seats.

        As the voice continues, we PULL BACK to reveal that the
        puppet is on the right hand of MR. GARRISON, a forty-six year
        old teacher who is in denial about his homosexuality.

<b>                             MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
</b>                   We have a lot to learn and precious
                   little time.

        Garrison looks over the class and notices that every single
        one of them is wearing a Terrance and Phillip T-shirt,
        except, of course, for Wendy.

<b>                             MR. GARRISON
</b>                   Why is everyone wearing T-shirts of
                   Sigfried and Roy?

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   It's not Sigried and Roy, Mr. Garrison,
                   it's Terrance and Phillip.

</b><b>                   TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!

        Stan looks over at Wendy. She just rolls her eyes. Stan
        sulks.

<b>                             MR. GARRISON
</b>                   Well, anyway... Today children, our
                   friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all
                   about the environment.

<b>                             MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
</b>                   That's right, Mr. Garrison. The
                   environment is what surrounds us. It is
                   what we live and breathe.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   I hate the environment.

</b>                   'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and
                   fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.

        The kids all GASP!

<b>                             MR. GARRISON

<b>                             CARTMAN

                   can't say fuck in front of Mr. Garrison.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   That's bullshit! If Terrance and Phillip
                   can say something, I should be able to
                   say it too!

<b>                             BEBE

        Cartman gloats proudly.

<b>                             CARTMAN

        Mr. Garrison is in shock.

        Cartman takes out a megaphone, hits the switch and puts it
        to his mouth. It feeds back horribly.

<b>        INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

        The boys are seated in front of the Principal's desk.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!

        Just then, the Principal walks in. She is PRINCIPAL VICTORIA,
        a frizzy haired woman of about forty.

<b>                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
</b>                   I am VERY disappointed in you boys!

                   I want you to THINK about what you've
                   done.

<b>                              CARTMAN

<b>                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
</b>                   AGH!! I want to know where you heard
                   these horrific obscenities!

        The boys look at each other.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Nowhere.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few
                   times before...

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Yeah!

<b>                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
</b>                   Boys, I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison
                   ever said-
                        (Reading)
                   'Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass
                   spelunker' in school!

        The boys all laugh.

        But then the door opens and in walks Stan's mother, Kyle's
        mother, Cartman's mother and Kenny's mother.

<b>                             STAN

        Stan looks down at the floor.

</b>                   No, worse. Here's a short list of the
                   things they've been saying.

        The mothers look over the sheet of paper. Immediately, their
        eyes bulge.

<b>                             STAN'S MOTHER

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER

<b>                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
</b>                   That's when the fist is inserted into the
                   anus or vagina for sexual pleasure.

        The two moms stare at Ms. Cartman.

<b>                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
</b>                   What?

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                        (To Kyle)
                   Young man, you will tell Peincipal
                   Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all

<b>                             CARTMAN

<b>                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   Terrance and Phillip are two VERY
                   untalented, unfunny actors from Canada.
                   Their TV show is filled with toilet humor
                   and bad language and is just complete
                   garbage.  Now it appears they have a
                   movie and I'm positive it's not suitable
                   for children!

<b>                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
</b>                   Well, it looks like I'll have to send a

        We see a clip from the video, "Unclefucka."

        The video has Terrance and Phillip dressed like Mase and

        Another nurse hands him a sucker tube.  He immediately shoves
        into Kenny's skull.  It starts to slurp and burble.

<b>                             DOCTOR GAUCHE

</b>                   Right!

        While Doctor Gauche wrestles with Kenny's lungs and torso,
        the nurse reaches into Kenny's mouth and pulls both his
        windpipe and esophagus out of his mouth, turning them inside
        out in the process.

        Off to the side, Stan, Cartman and Kyle look on as the doctor
        and nurses tangle themselves in knots with Kenny's innards.

<b>                             DOCTOR GAUCHE

        Kenny's liver POPS out of his torso and slides across the
        floor.

</b>                   Crack him.  Let's get it out of there!!!

        Doctor Gauche lifts Kenny's heart out of his body.

<b>                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
</b>                   We need to zap this, quick!

        And runs it to the microwave.  He opens the door.

</b>
        Fade up from black.  We're close on Kenny's face.  His little
        eyes start to open.

        Doctor Gauche leans over him Kenny.  Stan and Kyle are
        there.

<b>                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
</b>                   Kenny.  Kenny, can you hear me?

        Kenny stirs.

        Just then, Kenny's baked potato heart explodes, splattering
        gore all over the inside of the recovery room and on the
        outside of Dr. Gauche, Stan and Kyle.

        The doors to the hospital swing open, and the parents march

        After they leave, PUSH IN to Kenny's dead body, which is
        left all alone on the operating table.

        The camera continues to zoom in to Kenny's face...

        ZOOM IN on Kenny's dead face. We pass into his thoughs...

<b>        FLASH!!
</b>
<b>        EXT. SPACE -
</b>
        Kenny's body is floating through a great void. A PEACEFUL
        SONG plays as he soars upwards to the heavens.

        *note - except for Kenny's little construction paper body,
        this entire sequence should be done in 3D CGI.

        Ahead of him, Kenny can see a great white light. It appears
        warm and inviting.

        Now Kenny notices large beautiful breasts bobbing up and down
        in the heavens. He reaches out to touch them.

        Kenny blissfully floats upward toward the bright light and
        bobbing breasts. The music crescendos as Kenny gets almost
        close enough to the light to touch it.

        Just then, a huge, electronic sign pops up. 'Access Denied'.

        Suddenly, Kenny goes spiraling downward. The song changes to
        a MINISTRY type number as Kenny's surroundings start to
        become darker and more twisted.

        Kenny's hapless spirit enters a horrifying red tunnel, filled
        with flames and heat.

<b>                             KENNY

        Burning souls SCREAM and CRY all around Kenny, as his body
        plunges into what is now obviously the depths of hell.

        Kenny passes images of Hitler, John Wayne Gacy, hunger and
        disease as he continues through the twisting tunnel.

        He then passes images of Jimmy Stewart and Gandhi. All of
        whom are opportunely locked in hell for all eternity.

        The boys hang their heads and walks away.

        The ticket guy suddenly hears a bunch of commotion. He sees a
        mob of angry mothers, led by Kyle's mother.

</b>                   Cheers, Terrance!

        Terrance extricates himself from the band. Conan is growing
        nervous. He looks out into the audience...

        Kyle's mother is sitting there, looking angry. Conan makes
        eye contact with her, and then nods his head. Kyle's mother
        nods back.

                   So, guys, I need to ask you a serious
                   question...

<b>                             PHILLIP
</b>                   I just farted Terrance back into the
                   stone age!

        They both laugh hard.

        Brooke Shields waits a beat, then belts out a fake laugh.

</b>                   I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon!

<b>                             CONAN O'BRIAN
</b>                   Terrance and Phillip... Whose idea was

                   fire in your movie? <u>Who is responsible</u>
                   <u>for that?</u>

        Terrance and Phillip exhange glances.

<b>                             TERRANCE
</b>                   Phillip, I think our friend Conan has
                   been working too hard.

<b>                             CONAN O'BRIAN

</b>
        A battalion of Army guys appear, seize Terrance and Phillip

<b>                             CONAN O'BRIAN
</b>                   What have I done?!!!

        Conan grabs a gun and blows his head off, dousing Brooke
        Shields with blood.

        Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily. Kyle's mother cradles
        Conan's lifeless body.

        The boys are sitting on the couch in absolute shock.

        Establishing shot.

<b>        INT. UNITED NATIONS - GENERAL ASSEMBLY ROOM
</b>
        Lots of foreigners with their silly foreign outfits sit at
        their stupid microphones with their ridiculous translation
        headsets -- in the general assembly hall.  The Canadian
        Ambassador stands before them.

        A MURMUR goes through the crowd.

<b>                             CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
</b>                   We demand their release IMMEDIATELY!! As

                   economy of Canada relies on Terrance and
                   Phillip! Without them we are doomed to
                   recession!

        The United Nations head bangs his gavel.

        Now Kyle's mother stands up. She is with a group of mothers
        all wearing M.A.C T-shirts.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER

        More cheers from the Americans. The Canadians look worried.

<b>        INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

<b>                             BOB
</b>                   There's nothing I can do. I can still

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   FUCK Cheese-os and FUCK you!

        Cartman storms out. The boys follow him.

<b>        INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
        The boys walk into Cartman's house. Cartman slams the door
        behind him. The boys all walk toward the living room.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This

        But the boys come to an abrupt halt when they reach the
        living room and see that all four mothers are waiting for
        them, silently.

        Everyone just sits there for a second. The lighting on Kyle's
        mother's face looks almost evil.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER

<b>        INT. HELL - DAY
</b>
        Kenny walks through the black void of hell. A trippy, single
        shaft of light seems to follow him wherever he goes.

</b>                   Mphrmo?

        No answer... No nothing...

        Kenny continues on, flames shoot up randomly from the ground
        scaring the shit out of him.

<b>                             KENNY
</b><b>                   MPHR!! MMLY MMT!

        Suddenly, Kenny hears a CLAWING NOISE. It gets louder and
        louder. Kenny starts to run faster and faster. Now the
        clawing is RIGHT BEHIND HIM! Kenny spins around. He is face
        to face with SATAN!

        Satan looks down at Kenny and shoots flames out his nose.

        Kenny's eyes bulge open.

<b>                             KENNY

        Kenny shakes. Satan turns to a whispy form and flashes across
        the room like a serpent, in a millisecond he is right up in
        Kenny's face.

<b>                             SATAN

        Kenny tries to run away, but Satan again changes form, flies
        across the room and cuts Kenny off.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Come with me. I will show you what

        Two black DEMONS grab Kenny by the arms and start to lead him

        The kids are sitting in chairs in a circle.  There are anti-
        drug signs on the walls: "Crack is Whack"; "Get High on
        Pottery"; and, "I Go From Zero to Bitch in .9 Seconds."  MR.
        MACKEY, the wiry school counselor, leads the group.  There's
        a pottery wheel and lots of craft tables behind them.

<b>                             MR. MACKEY
</b>                   Mkay, it's come to my attention, that you
                   boys have a potty-mouth problem, mkay.
                   Now the sooner you recognize your
                   problem, mkay, the sooner we can get you
                   back to your third grade homeroom where
                   you belong.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   But they're just words, Mr. Mackey. Our
                   parents are over-reacting.

<b>                             BEBE
</b>                   Yeah, Wendy's here, and she doesn't even
                   like Terrance and Phillip!

        Wendy looks bored. Stan tries to smile at her, but she
        doesn't even acknowledge him.

        Meanwhile, Cartman is violently shaking in his seat.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having

<b>                             MR. MACKEY
</b>                   Mkay, kids from all over the State have
                   been brought here, because you all share
                   the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's
                   start with you.

        He points at Gregory. The little British bastard from the
        lake.

        Wendy looks at Gregory. Stan notices this.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   You've got a stupid accent too.

<b>                             MR. MACKEY
</b>                   Eric, that is not appropriate.

</b>                   What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the
                   ear.

<b>                             MR. MACKEY
</b>                   Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly
                   what I'm talking about. We have to change
                   the way you think.

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   How are you gonna do that?

        Mr. Mackey crosses to a piano. He plays chords while speaking
        the following lines.

<b>                             MR. MACKEY
</b>                   There are times when you get suckered in,
                   by drugs and alcohol and sex with wom-en.

        Mr. Mackey plays the piano and sings:

        The kids are extremely disinterested. Mackey walks over to a
        chalkboard.

        Kyle's mom and the other moms watch the kids and Mr. Mackey
        rolling around on the floor laughing on a security monitor.

        Just then, Kyle's mother walks in with a scowling look,
        interupting the kids and Mr. Mackey who are still laughing
        merrily. The other mothers are behind her.

        A news reporter stands in front of the Supreme Court. All
        around him are protestors, with signs that say CANADA NO! and
        CAN'TADA! Still others hold signs with Kenny on them.

                   trial of the - day - is happening.
                   Thousands of people have shown up from
                   all over the country to show their
                   outrage and disgust at Canada. Joining me
                   now is Mrs. McKormick, mother of the poor
                   little boy who was killed by the
                   Canadians.

        Kenny's mother steps into frame. She is wearing a shirt with
        Kenny's picture on it. Written on the T-shirt is 'Have you
        seen my son? No, you haven't. He's dead.'

                   That's the Motion Picture Association of

</b>                   Hey Terrance. I feel like I'm going to

<b>        INT. PTA MEETING - DAY
</b>
        A large crowd of parents has gathered for a PTA meeting.

        Kenny's mother is at a table selling dead Kenny t-shirts. She
        has a shitload of money all around her. Another MOTHER walks
        up, hands Kenny's mom money, and gets a shirt.

<b>                             MOTHER
</b>                   Is that a new pearl bracelet, Mrs.
                   McKormick?

<b>                             KENNY'S MOTHER
</b>                   Why yes. Yes it is.

        Meanwhile, Kyle's mother is on the stand.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   As our next official order of business
                   here at M.A.C., we will test the new V-
                   chip. As most of you know, the V-chip was
                   created to lock children out of watching
                   certain shows on television. And now the
                   N.I.H. has created a new, exciting
                   product that they can tell us all about.
                   Here is the Surgeon General, Dr.
                   Pangloss.

        DOCTOR PANGLOSS, a lab technician in white takes the podium.

<b>                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
</b>                   Thank you, parents.

        One person claps. Pangloss hits a button and a slide
        projector starts showing pictures of the device.

<b>                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
</b>                   The machinery of the new 'V-chip' is very
                   simple, and similar to that of the V-
                   chip. The chip is placed just under the
                   subject's skin, where it emits a small
                   but painful shock of electricity whenever
                   an obscenity is uttered.

        The parents are fascinated.

<b>                             STAN'S FATHER
</b>                   Now wait a minute, are you telling us
                   that this chip somehow KNOWS if the kid
                   is swearing?

<b>                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
</b>                   It's just like a lie detector. Certain
                   things happen in you when you swear just
                   like when you lie, the chip picks up on
                   this and gives the subject a shock.

        The parents AD LIB 'Ooohs' and 'Ahhhhs'

<b>                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
</b>                   We are very excited to see the results of
                   this test.
                        (Calling)
                   Patient 453, would you step out here,
                   please?

        Cartman steps out wearing a hospital gown.

<b>                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
</b>                   Patient 453 here has been fitted with the
                   new v-chip...

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   My head hurts.

<b>                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
</b>                   Don't worry about that. Now, I want you
                   to say 'Doggy.'

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Doggy.

<b>                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
</b>                   Notice that nothing happens.
                        (To Cartman)
                   Now say 'Montana.'

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Montana.

<b>                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
</b>                   Good. Now 'Pillow'.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Pillow.

<b>                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
</b>                   Alright, now I want you to say
                   'horsefucker.'

        Cartman looks offstage to his mother.

<b>                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER

        Just then, the door bursts open and in walks a couple of Nazi
        looking American soldiers.

        They walk over to the children and start pulling off their
        'Free Terrance and Phillip' pins.

        Suddenly, Chef realizes who he's talking to.

        The television goes from that Emergency broadcast signal to a
        scene of a news anchor sitting at his desk.

        Kyle's mom appears on the TV dressed in military garb.

<b>                             PRESIDENT
</b>                   Mrs. Sheila Brovlofski.

<b>                             CHEF
</b>                   Isn't that your mother, Kyle?

        Kyle can't believe it.

        On the television, Kyle's mother walks up to the podium. She
        is dressed to the hilt. She hugs the President and the first
        lady and then takes a deep breath.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   My fellow Americans. I have led this
                   fight in the War against profanity. I
                   have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our
                   neighbor to the north has abused us for
                   the last time.

<b>                             PRESIDENT
</b>                   As Commander in chief, I have ordered our
                   Army to set up defensive positions along
                   the US-Canada border in anticipation of
                   an attack.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   What about air strikes?

<b>                             PRESIDENT
</b>                   Huh?

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   We have to have air strikes on their
                   military and entertainment centers.  It's
                   the only way to ensure that their smut
                   can't reach American soil!

<b>                             PRESIDENT
</b>                   Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes
                   are necessary.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I
                   remind you that our country's heart and
                   soul are at stake, and our children's
                   minds are the battlefield!
                   The bastard Canadians want to fight us
                   because we won't tolerate their potty
                   mouths. Well, if it is war they want...
<b>                   THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
</b>
        A huge eruption of cheers from the crowd in front of Kyle's
        mother. She is obviously floored by it. She can't help but
        smile. She actually holds her head up higher, and then raises
        her arms up in two peace signs, as the cheers get louder.

        The president forces a smile and actually applauds with the
        rest of the crowd.

        Back in the gymnasium, Kyle looks thoroughly embarrassed.

<b>                             CHEF

        Kenny's eyes bulge, he wants to see more, but Satan clicks
        off the television and sits up in bed.

                   seventh sign.

        Satan walks over to large pedestal which holds an ancient
        tome.  Satan turns the pages as he talks.

        Satan reaches over and turns off the light.  Everything goes
        pitch black. The light goes off of Kenny's face as well.

        A beat.

        Then, a small moan from Satan.

        Stan and Kyle walk into the middle of town, where a HUGE
        bonfire of Terrance and Phillip videos, posters, and Canadian
        items like syrup and hockey sticks are burning away.

        The soldiers throw Stan's book on top of the pile, and it
        starts to burn.

        Stan and Kyle walk up to where Cartman is standing.

        Several random mothers from M.A.C. are standing in front of
        the bonfire with anti-Canadian signs and T-shirts. The boys'
        parents aren't around, but another MAC mother is leading the

</b>                   What is quickly being referred to as 'The
                   Great Canadian-American War' has already
                   reached a death toll of two million.

        Cartman's mother reaches over and switches off the radio.

<b>                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
</b>                   Goodnight, honey.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Mom... When is the war gonna be over?

<b>                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
</b>                   I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You
                   want it to end quickly, huh?

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz
                   all my favorite TV shows have been
                   replaced by news and it's pissing me off.

<b>                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
</b>                   Oh.

        With that, Cartman's mother gets up-

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Mom...

<b>                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
</b>                   Yes, hon?

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   If you went down on a horse... You'd tell
                   me, right?

<b>                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
</b>                   Sure, hon. Goodnight.

        She switches off the light, and leaves.

        Cartman lies there, lit only by soft, blue moonlight and
        thinks.

        He hears a SCRAPING noise, and looks a little scared, but
        then tries to close his eyes to sleep.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Go away, scary noise.

        Again the SCRAPING. Cartman pops open hs eyes to see -

        KENNY! He is transparent and floating above Cartman's bed.

        Cartman is horrified. Too much so to even scream.

        Kenny puts his hands to his mouth to try and speak, but he
        makes no sound.

        Finally, Cartman lets out a piercing cry.

        Cartman's mother comes running in, just as the image of Kenny
        disappears.

<b>                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
</b>                   Eric?! Eric, what is it?!

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!

        Cartman's mother looks around and sees nothing. Finally, she
        just cradles Cartman's fat head in her arms.

<b>                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
</b>                   Oh you poor dear. You've been through so
                   much...

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire
                   and now he's all pissed off!!
<b>                       (BZZTZT!)
</b>                   AGH! I can't say pissed off?!
<b>                       (BAZZTZT!!)

</b>
<b>        INT. HELL - DAY (MOVED)
</b>
        Kenny is again snooping around. He quietly creaks Satan's
        door open and walks in.

        Satan is in his room, looking at a map of Earth.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   The execution of Terrance and Phillip is
                   imminent, soon all hell shall rise!!

        Kenny looks scared.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                       (Evil and scary)
                   Are you afraid, little one? Afraid for
                   the souls of your pitiful friends that-

        Suddenly, Saddam walks in carrying some bags.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   Hey Satan!  I got some great new home
                   furnishings today!

        Satan rolls his eyes and sighs. His attempt to be evil to
        Kenny is squashed again.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   Boy buddy Rich, it was a bitch to get
                   something to match with that bathroom
                   tile!

        Saddam looks at Kenny.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   Oh, hey kid. Find those proofs of
                   purchases yet? No?! Gee, whatta surprise!
                   Well, keep lookin!

        A beat. Satan folds his arms and looks at the floor, pissed.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Do you wanna know what <u>I</u> did today?

        Saddam lets out a sigh.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   What did you do today Satan?

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   You don't care.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon
                   thing has got you all stressed out. Let's
                   make love.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Do you remember when you first got here?
                   We used to talk all night long. Until the
                   sun came up... We would just lie in bed
                   and TALK.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   That's because I wanted to fuck you,
                   dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those
                   pants down!

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Don't call me dumb!

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!

        As this conversation happens, Kenny's eyes dart back and
        forth as if watching a tennis match.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   How come you always want to make love to
                   me from behind? Is it because you want to
                   pretend I'm somebody else?

        Saddam sighs.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   Satan, your ass is gigantic and red, who
                   am I gonna pretend you are? Helen Reddy?

        A beat.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   Come on, kid. Help me with these shower
                   curtains.

        Saddam and Kenny walk out. Leaving Satan all alone with sad
        music playing.

<b>                             SATAN

                   But then, I sink
                   because it's here I'm supposed to
                   stay
                   but I don't even know how or why
                   its supposed to be that way-</b>

        Satan walks to his veranda.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   <b>Up there, there is so much room

        Satan walks over to a bright blue globe and spins it slowly.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   <b>They say I don't belong
                   That my place is down below

                   But what is evil anyway?
                   Is there reason to the rhyme?
                   Without evil there could be no good
                   So it must be good to be evil

        PULL BACK, big crane shot rising above Satan.

<b>        EXT. SMALL ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
        A dim light is all that is visible from inside the small
        building.

<b>        INT. LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT
</b>
        Stan and Kyle are painting a sign on the wall 'La

        Cartman comes running in, he looks scared.

        Kyle opens the door. The golden haired young boy from rehab
        stands there looking handsome and angelic.

<b>                             GREGORY

        Another kid walks up next to Gregory, it's Wendy. Stan's eyes
        grow wide.

<b>                             STAN

        Gregory takes Wendy's hand and pushes his way in. Stan fumes.

<b>        INT. LA RESISTANCE - LATER

        Now the room is filled with a bunch of scared looking
        RESISTANCE FOLLOWERS. All of whom are under the age of
        twelve.

        The room is lit only by candlelight. And the large 'VIVA LA
        RESISTANCE' banner hands on the wall.

        Stan and Kyle look nervous.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Everyone be seated, please.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Wow, a lot of people showed up.

<b>                             STAN

</b>                   Me?!

        Stan looks out over the faces. Gregory checks his watch.

<b>                             STAN

                   Kay. Uh... Terrance and Phillip are
                   supposed to be killed, and we think that
                   sucks ass!!

        The kids don't respond. Stan shoots a nervous look at Wendy,
        who is sitting next to Gregory.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Uhh... So we think we should prank call a

        Again no response. Gregory rolls his eyes.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Uhh...

        Gregory stands up.

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   May I?

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   What?

        Gregory takes Stan's place at the front of the group.

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   Terrance and Phillip are currently being
                   held at a Canadian Internment camp two
                   kilometers outside of town.
                   They are to be executed tomorrow during a
                   star-studded USO show for the troops.

        Gregory pulls a big map out of nowhere and rolls it out. Stan
        and Kyle can't believe it.

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   We must sneak into the camp through this
                   duct, freeing Terrance and Phillip
                   inside... The war is escalating, and the
                   American forces are preparing for a large
                   scale attack on Canada. That means the
                   time is now...

        Stan shoots Kyle a dirty look.

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   This is a dangerous mission, so I'll go

        Wendy smiles at Gregory.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   No!

        Everyone looks at Stan.

<b>                             STAN

<b>        INT. SOUTH PARK - AMERICAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS
</b>
        A huge hall is filled with hundreds of soldiers in different
        battalions.

        We see our regulars: Mr. Garrison with a uniformed Mr. Hat,
        Mr. Mackey, Jimbo and Ned, Bo, Pip, Stan's Grandfather,
        Jesus, Officer Barbrady....

<b>                             JIMBO

<b>                             NED

                   USO tomorrow with celebrities and
                   executions!

        PAN OVER to Mr. Garrison.

<b>                             MR. GARRISON
</b>                   You look great in your new uniform Mr.
                   Hat.

<b>                             MR. HAT
</b>                   You do too, Mr. Garrison.

<b>                             MR. GARRISON
</b>                   Boy, I can't wait for our first shore-
                   leave so I can go get me some poontang.

        Chef sits down in a seat behind Garrison near the back.

        GENERAL PLYMKIN, a gruff old army type with bug eyes, steps
        up to a podium and addresses the troops.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b><b>                   PAY ATTENTION!

        The crowd settles down.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   It's no secret that the Evil Canadian
                   Federation has scored major victories all
                   over the United State.  We have brought
                   you here because you ar America's best,
                   and last hope.

        Another general leans over to Plymkin and whispers in his
        ear.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   Oh... Apparently you're not the best,
                   you're simply the last. Anyway, let's
                   strategize... Map!

        A large, holographic 3-D map of South Park springs up in
        front of him.  He walks around it pointing out things with a
        laser-pointer.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   Our sources have told us that the

                   USO show and stop us from executing
                   Terrance and Phillip.

        He points to a spot on the 3-D map.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   Now each battalion has a specific code-
                   name and mission.  Battalion 5, raise
                   your hands-

        Chef is in Battalion 5 and dutifully raises his hand.

        Then he looks around and notices to his surprise that
        everybody else in his section is also African American.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   You will be the all-important first

                   'Operation Human Shield'.

<b>                             CHEF
</b>                   Hey, wait a minute...

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   Now keep in mind, 'Operation Human

                   don't lose your spirit men!  Stay until

        A bunch of white guys raise their hands.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   Right, you are 'Operation Get Behind The
                   Darkies'.  You will follow Battalion 5
                   here-

        He points to a spot on the 3-D map.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   -and try not to get killed for God's
                   Sake.  Are there any questions men?

        Chef raises his hand.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   Yes soldier?

<b>                             CHEF
</b>                   Have you ever heard of the Emancipation
                   Proclamation?

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   I don't listen to hip-hop.

        Chef scowls.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   If you somehow live, we will regroup on
                   this hill outside--

        Suddenly, the 3-D hologram starts to flicker and fizzle.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   Now what's wrong with this thing?

        General Plymkin messes with the controls.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   Fucking windows 98!

        General Plymkin has pulled the plug. He stands there with
        the cord in his hands.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b><b>                   GET GATES IN HERE!!!

        BILL GATES walks in, escorted by two MILITARY GUARDS.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b><b>                   YOU TOLD US WINDOWS 98 WOULD BE FASTER

        Plymkin pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head. Gates
        falls to the floor, dead.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN

<b>        INT. LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT
</b>
        In the dead of night, the kids are all in a circle discussing
        the plan.

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   ...after you clear this zone here,
                   rendezvous behind this ridge where
                   Terrance and Phillip should be held.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Gotcha.

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   You are indeed brave, but you will need
                   someone who's done this sort of thing
                   before.  MOLE!

        Suddenly, a bump in the ground starts to move forward, leaving
        a trail behind it. (like bugs bunny before he pops out)

        The bump comes to a stop at the children's feet and out pops
        THE MOLE.  He is a very bitter little nine year old French
        kid with a THICK French accent.

<b>                             VOICE
</b>                   Oui?

<b>                             GREGORY

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   So... We must free more Canadian

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Yeah, I guess.

</b>                   America... She iz a beetch that sheets on
                   her own children.

        Stan and Kyle look at each other confused.

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   This is the Mole.  He will accompany you
                   to the prison where Terrance and Phillip
                   are.  He is an expert in covert
                   operations and a lifelong fighter for
                   freedom.

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   Freedom... It's like cow's urine poured
                   down your troat. You wonder 'Do I want
                   this?' I'm thersty... But it's urine.

        Everyone stares at The Mole.

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   Good luck Stan, I'll make sure Wendy
                   is... kept safe?

        Stan gets pissed.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Give me Terrance and Phillip or give me

        Now, Gregory breaks into song. His voice is absolutely
        gorgeous and deep. He puts his hand on Stan's shoulder.

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   <b>God has smiled upon you this day
                   The fate of a nation in your
                   hands...</b>

        Stan and Kyle look at each other. They can't believe how good
        this guy's voice is. Wendy appears enthralled.

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   <b>As brothers and sisters we unite

                   Until only the most righteous

        The music builds. Gregory gets up on a soapbox.

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   <b>Do you see the distant flames?

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   What? Shot?

        Kyle and the boys look a little worried, as other kids join
        in the song.

<b>                             KIDS
</b>                   <b>You might get stabbed in the head

<b>                             GREGORY
</b>                   <b>But when they torture you

        American flags. Kenny's mother is counting money she has made
        from selling t-shirts.

        Kenny keeps watching as Saddam throws on a Shakey's hat and
        does a quick softshoe. Satan rolls his eyes.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN

                   go grab a drink.

        Saddam leaves. Satan looks about to cry, but then notices
        Kenny still standing there.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   What are you doing?! Get on with your

<b>                             KENNY
</b>                   Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.

        Satan lowers his head. Slowly he starts to cry. Kenny walks
        over and pats him on the back.

<b>        EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND
</b>
        Tents and makeshift buildings are lined up against the
        mountains.  Jeeps and Tanks buzz to and fro.

        There's a huge stage which is set up with thousands of seats.
        There's a giant banner reading "USO SHOW TONIGHT!!!!!"

        Loads of soldiers file into their seats.

<b>                             ANNOUNCER
</b>                   Alright you men! The USO show is about to
                   start!!

        The military men go wild.

                   immediately by the swift and nasty
                   execution of Terrance and Elroy!

        The crowd goes crazy again.

<b>        EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - BEHIND THE USO SHOW - DUSK
</b>
        Right out of Nazi Germany.  Barbed wire, guards, the whole
        bit.

<b>        ANGLE ON BOYS
</b>
        They are on their backs, shimmying along the ground
        underneath the blanket of razor-wire that is set up around
        the camp.

        The Mole uses the bolt-cutters to cut the wire as he goes,
        clearing a path for Stan, Kyle and Cartman.

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   Be careful not to touch this wire-

        A wire catches on Cartman's arm and SNAPS against his face.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b><b>                   OW!  MOTHERFUCKER!

</b>
<b>                             CARTMAN
</b><b>                   FUC-

        Stan shoves his hand over Cartman's mouth, leaving Cartman to
        cuss bloody murder into Stan's glove.

<b>                             CARTMAN

        Finally they clear the fence and lie down in view of the
        camp.

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   It sounds like the USO show has started.
                   We have precious little time...

        Kyle looks at the horrible concentration camp.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Oh my God...

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   God? ...Let me tell you something about
                   God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.

        Kyle looks at The Mole, oddly.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   How are we ever gonna find them?

        The Mole whips out some night vision goggles.

<b>        ANGLE ON INTERMENT CAMP THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES
</b>
        The Mole inspects the camp.  He sees a guard on a guard
        tower.  Then he pans over to a bunch of Canadians standing
        in a line in rags.

        The Mole quickly clicks the magnification to high so we see
        the saddened faces of the Canadians.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and
                   Phillip?

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   No. Zey must have zem inside. We will
                   have to dig.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   That's gonna take a long time!

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   Time? Did time matter to the
                   Revolutionists who were forced to eat
                   their own shit while dying in the
                   dungeons of ze King?

        The boys think.

<b>        EXT. USO SHOW - DAY
</b>
        Helicopters zoom over the makeshift stage like the USO show
        in Apocalypse Now.

        Groups of soldiers cheer as a helicopter approaches the
        landing platform and touches down.  The US army men cheer.

        The mothers take the stage, and Kyle's mother speaks into the
        microphone. Behind her is a huge American flag. She is
        wearing an army helmet. This is right out of 'Patton'.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   Ladies and gentlemen of the American war

        A big cheer goes through the crowd. Kyle's mother feels the
        power, and lifts her head high. She starts to pace back and
        forth on the stage as she speaks, becoming more and more
        Pattonlike.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER

        Out of the helicopter emerge a battalion of the best and
        brightest stars that the American show biz industry has to
        offer.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   Pint size pixie and darling of the indie
                   movie scene, Winona Ryder!

        She gestures grandly to the helicopter where Winona Ryder
        emerges and runs to center stage and waves to the audience.
        She looks like a strung out coke addict; because she is.

<b>                             WINONA RYDER

</b>                   I want you all to know I'm super psyched

                   you're doing for our country so sooo
                   cool.  It's so real.  I've been acting
                   since I was twelve and I can't
                   distinguish between make believe and real
                   life.

        Winona falls down. But gets back up immediately.

<b>                             WINONA RYDER
</b>                   And then I confuse me real life with my

                   Christ, look at me.  It's not my fault
                   that I can get any guy I want.  And
                   that's reality to me.  But you guys...
                   wow.  I mean, war, man. Fucking war.  It
                   doesn't get any more real--  Now, this
                   one goes out to you.

        She cues the band which has been assembled from the same
        helicopter.  Jazz music starts up.

        It's 'New York, New York'. The troops look confused.

<b>                             WINONA RYDER

        The mole is digging frantically while the boys follow on all
        fours.  Cartman holds a flashlight.

        A beat.

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   Or, we can dig UP.

        The mole starts digging up towards the ground.

<b>        EXT. INSIDE THE PRISON CAMP
</b>
        Mole pops his head out of the ground. Immediately, a search
        light passes over the hole.

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   Sheet!

        Mole ducks, just avoiding the light.

        Slowly, the boys' heads appear from the hole.

        The whole camp is in front of them.  There is a HUGE
        barbedwire fence on one side (the side they just dug from)  A
        dozen armed guards with huge Dobermans patrol the grounds with
        Howitzers.  It doesn't look good.

<b>                             THE MOLE

        One by one, The Mole, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman pop out of the
        ground, and run for a nearby building.  Once at the building,

        The entire place goes incredibly quiet.

        You can hear a pin drop.

        Silence...

        Deafening silence...

<b>                             BIG GAY AL
</b><b>                   JUST KIDDING!! FUCK 'EM!!!

        Slow music swells in. Big Gay Al saunters around the stage
        and starts to sing.

<b>                             BIG GAY AL

        Suddenly, Big Gay Al is wearing a big feathery outfit and all
        his dancers dash to his side.

<b>                             BIG GAY AL

<b>        EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - ANOTHER AREA
</b>
        Cartman is by himself, slowly moving from building to
        building. He is scared out of his mind.

        He approaches the electrical box.  Just as he's about to open
        it, two armed AMERICAN SOLDIERS round the corner.  Cartman
        gets scared and hides in the shadows.  The soldiers continue
        walking...

<b>                             AMERICAN SOLDIER
</b>                   Dude, if I was gay, I'd be just like Big

        The boys are waiting, bored, for The Mole to return.

</b>                   I don't think he's coming back, dude.

        Just then, we hear The Mole return from his hole. He is
        carrying the ticket guy from the movie theater.

<b>                             TICKET GUY

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   Oh... Alright, back you go.

        The Mole takes the Ticket Guy back through the hole.

<b>                             TICKET GUY
</b>                   No! Please! I don't want to go back!!

        The boys sit back down and wait again.

        The chorus guys all pick Big Gay Al up and dance around with
        him on stage.

        The song ends and everyone erupts into applause.

<b>        INT. HELL - DAY
</b>
        Satan is looking into a large, oracle-like ball. Saddam isn't
        around, but a few demons and Kenny are hanging out.

                   blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the
                   day is ours!

        Two of the demons head for Satan's room.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   No! Not Saddam. Don't wake him... Uh...
                   I'll tell him...

        Satan walks to the bedroom.

<b>        EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - ELECTRICAL BOX AREA
</b>
        Cartman approaches the electrical box nervously -- looking
        all around for soldiers.

        He opens the door to the electrical box and sees a large
        switch labeled ON and OFF.  He reaches to turn off the switch
        when he feels a tap on his shoulder.

        Cartman jumps.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Agh!!!

        Then turns and karate-chops in one spastic flurry to see -

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Son of a gun!  HECK!

        Kenny's ghost is again floating in front of Cartman. Kenny
        again struggles to speak.

<b>                             CARTMAN

        Ike is still just sitting quietly in the dark attic.

</b>
        Kyle is patiently awaiting Mole's return.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Damn it! Come on, Mole we're running out
                   of time!

        Kyle spins around when he hears someone coming.

        But it's only Cartman. He's panting heavily.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   You guys! Seriously! You guys!

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   What Cartman?!

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Kenny! I saw Kenny again!

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Oh, brother.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?

        Cartman stops breathing heavily and thinks.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Cartman?!

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Whoops.

        Just then, all the alarms in the place go off.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Oh shit!

        From the distance, the boys hear gunshots.

        Suddenly, the Mole pops out of the hole. The boys see that
        The Mole has been shot up badly.

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   Ze alarms! Zey went off!

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.

        As SHOUTS and RUNNING FOOTSTEPS draw closer, The Mole lays
        down and begins to die in Kyle's arms.

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   Please... Do not let ze resistance die...

        Gentle MUSIC begins.

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   <b>Now the light, she fades
                   And darkness closes in
                   But I will find strength
                   I will find pride within
                   Because although I die
                   Our freedom will be won
                   Though I die
                   Ze Resistance
                   Lives on...</b>

        The Music fades away, as the Mole coughs up some blood.

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   It's so very cold...

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   We can't leave without you!

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   It's okay, I am done for.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU -
                   we don't know where the hell we are!!

        The Mole coughs up more blood.

<b>                             THE MOLE
</b>                   Where is your God when you need him?
                   Where is your beautiful, merciful faggot
                   now?

        The Mole dies.

<b>                             KYLE

        The boys look up to see three large MARINES pointing guns at
        them.

        Stan makes a run for it. He dashes off at full speed.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Run, Stan!!

        One of the soldiers fires at him. PWANG! PWANG! But Stan
        disappears into the night.

<b>                             PENTAGON GUY
</b>                   Forget him! The night will swallow him
                   up.

<b>        EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT
</b>
        Kyle's mother, and the other mothers of MAC, take the stage
        again.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   And now, for our big finale, the MOMENT
<b>                   YOU HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!!!
</b>
        Terrance and Phillip are wheeled out onto the stage.

<b>                             TERRANCE
</b>                   Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.

<b>                             PHILLIP
</b>                   I know, Terrance.  This is quite the
                   shitstorm we've found ourselves in this
                   time.

        From the other side, Kyle's mom appears with a couple of
        official looking military people.  The crowd cheers.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOM
</b>                   It is my pleasure to present to you, THE

        The crowd cheers.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOM
</b>                   Strap them in!

        Terrance and Phillip are then greeted by the EXECUTIONER,
        donned in a black hood.

        The scary giant Executioner grabs Terrance and Phillip and
        puts them into electric chairs.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOM
</b>                   Today is a great day for democracy!

        The crowd cheers.

        The Executioner steps up to the throw switch.

<b>                             TERRANCE
</b>                   Phillip, this is worse than that trip to
                   Quebec City when I fell asleep in that
                   disco.

<b>                             PHILLIP
</b>                   I know, Terrance. I know.

<b>        EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH PARK - NIGHT
</b>
        LONG SHOT of a desolate, dark area.

        It has started to rain. Stan trudges through the wilderness
        looking tired and scared.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Hello? Where the hell am I? Is anybody
                   here?

        A few wolf HOWLS sound in the distance. Stan walks on.

<b>                             STAN
</b><b>                   MARCO!!!
</b>
        No answer.

<b>                             STAN
</b><b>                   MARCO!!!
</b>
        No answer. Stan stumbles a bit.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Dude, weak... Can't go on... Dizzy...

        Stan falls to the ground. His face plops in the rainy mud and
        his head smacks against a rock.

        Stan is out cold.

        Just then, a strange sound emerges. It is like a pulsating
        WOBBLE. Stan slowly awakes, picks up his head and shines his
        flashlight around.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   What is that?

        The sound gets louder. Stan shines his flashlight on
        something that is huge and throbbing.

<b>                             STAN
</b><b>                   OH MY GOD!!!

<b>        EXT. STAGE - NIGHT

        Kyle's mother approaches Terrance and Phillip.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOM
</b>                   Gentlemen, do you have any last words?

<b>                             PHILLIP

                   that for last words?

        Kyle's mom nods to the Executioner.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b><b>                   WAIT!!

        General Plymkin walks out next to Kyle's mother.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   We have just captured some Canadian
                   Sympathizers!

        The crowd cheers. Kyle's mother smiles.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   We will execute them along with Terrance
                   and Phillip for your viewing pleasure!

        Another cheer. The mothers are all very pleased. That is,
        until they see Kyle and Cartman brought out to the stage at
        gunpoint.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   Kyle?!

        Now Ike is brought out at gunpoint.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   Ike?!

        Kyle's mother rushes over to General Plymkin.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   General... These are OUR CHILDREN!

<b>                             STAN'S MOTHER
</b>                   But they're CHILDREN!

        Cartman walks over to where Terrance and Phillip are strapped
        into their chairs.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Dude! Terrance and Phillip! Wow! Can I

<b>                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
</b>                   Yes, I think shooting our children would

        Stan is still lying in mud, but now he lies before a HUGE,
        pulsating, organic looking thing that belongs in the X-Files.
        It's the size of a small building.

        The massive thing starts to glow. Stan looks weak and afraid.

<b>                             BIG THING

                   over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.

        The clitoris fades, and just as it does, all the kids of La
        Resistance come running into frame. Wendy and Gregory are
        with them as well.

        start to fry. Kyle, Cartman and Ike, in their chairs, look
        horrified.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   Goodbye, bastards!

        Near death, Terrance cranks out a weak fart. Terrance and
        Phillip both laugh weakly but merrily.

<b>                             TERRANCE
</b>                   Take that, bitch.

        As Terrance and Phillip fry, they scream out:

<b>                             PHILLIP/TERRANCE
</b><b>                   FREEEEEEDOMMMMM!!!
</b>
        Suddenly, FWWOOOMMM!!! A Bomb lands in the middle of the
        army. BLAM!! It explodes with incredible force, sending dead
        bodies in all directions.

        Canadian military planes zoom overhead! It's a full scale
        attack!!

        From a HIGH ANGLE we see the soldiers all scatter like bugs
        in every direction.

<b>                             MR. GARRISON

</b>
        FWWOOMM!!! BLAMM!! Another explosion!  Everybody just starts
        screaming and shooting in every direction.  Total and
        complete mayhem.

        One explosion knocks out the electricity, and Terrance and
        Phillip stop drying.

        The electricity runs along a wire, across the stage, and
        right up Cartman's leg. Cartman starts frying horribly.

<b>                             KYLE
</b><b>                   CARTMAN!

<b>                             PHILLIP
</b>                   What's going on Terrance?

<b>                             TERRANCE
</b>                   Canada is saving us!!

        Finally, Cartman is blown clear of the electricity. Kyle
        picks him up and starts to run along with Ike.

<b>        INT. HELL - SATAN'S BEDROOM
</b>
        Satan opens the door to find Saddam sleeping happily in his
        cozy bed. He is only wearing little black g-string panties.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                       (Whispering)
                   Have you finished?

        Now we see that Kenny is standing at the foot of the bed. He
        holds a gasoline can, and has just finished pouring the last
        drops underneath the bed.

<b>                             KENNY

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Then move out of the way.

        Kenny walks over next to Satan. Satan pulls out a book of
        matches.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   I must be strong... I must be strong...

        Satan tries to light the match. It won't light.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Damn it...

        Finally, the match lights. Satan holds it up-

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Goodbye, Saddam...

        -and throws it onto the bed.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Come on!

        Saddam burns to a crisp and Satan and Kenny run out.

<b>        EXT. USO SHOW - DAY
</b>
        People run screaming in all directions as a full scale attack
        has broken out. Gunfire, explosions and dead bodies fly all
        around.

<b>                             JIMBO
</b>                   Ned!  Behind you!

        Ned whips around and mows down a line of Canadians. But one
        Canadian makes it through, and sticks his bayonet through
        Ned's neck.

        Blood gushes from Ned's neck as he collapses.

<b>                             JIMBO
</b><b>                   NED!!! NOOOOOOO!!!!!

        FWWOOM!! BLAMMM!!! The boys runs as fast as they can amidst
        the explosions.

<b>                   AGHAGHGAH!!
</b>
        Now when the V-chip shocks Cartman, we can actually see the
        blue current swirl around his body.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b><b>                   HEY! THIS V-CHIP IS GETTING ALL SCREWY!!
</b>
        General Plymkin has followed his men into the trench, where
        explosions and gunfire fly all around. He pulls out a walkie
        talkie as his men die all around him.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN

</b>
        They all fall in.  A phalanx of black men, Chef included in
        them, walk out in front of a bunch of white guys.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b><b>                   REMEMBER, HUMAN SHIELD!  PROTECT OUR
</b><b>                   TANKS AND PLANES, TOO!
</b>
        Just then, over a ridge in front of them, a line of Canadian
        tanks appears. The tanks are lined up 3 deep.  Behind them is
        a line of missile launchers.  General Plymkin's jaw drops.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   Holy Mother of Johosephat...

        The black guys all look at each other nervously.

<b>        EXT. BATTLEFIELD
</b>
        The boys run through the chaos.  Body parts and scrapnel fly
        here and there.

        A bloody soldier suddenly stumbles and falls in front of the
        boys holding a massive head wound.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Hey! It's Mr. Garrison!!

        Garrison lies on the ground, coughing up blood.

<b>                             MR. GARRISON
</b>                   Children... Take Mr. Hat... Please... Get
                   him out of here...

        Garrison takes Mr. Hat off his hand and gives it to Cartman.

        Just then, Garrison goes limp.

        Cartman looks at the Mr. Hat in his hand and scowls. The boys
        run from the battle.

        They pass the American troops, where all the black guys are
        standing in a human shield around the white guys.

<b>                             CHEF

        The Canadian tanks take aim.

<b>                             CHEF
</b><b>                   TWO!

</b><b>                   THREE!!

        All the black guys suddenly jump out of the way, leaving the
        whites completely exposed.

<b>                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
</b>                   What the-

        The tank fire hits the army, blowing all the white soldiers
        to smithereens, including Ned and Jimbo.

<b>        EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY
</b>
        From an EXTREME WIDE SHOT, we see all the forces on both
        sides exchange firepower. The Canadian National anthem can be
        heard in the distance.

        We see Mr. Mackey looking like a natural born killer.  He
        shoots like a maniac into the Canadians.  He wounds one and
        then marches over to the wriggling body with a knife.

<b>                             MR. MACKEY
</b>                   Die Canadian, mmkay?!

        And he drives the knife into the Canadian's chest.

        But then, suddenly, another Canadian Soldier appears out of
        nowhere, and blows a hole through Mackey's chest.

<b>                             MR. MACKEY
</b>                   Mkay-

        Mackey falls to the ground, dead. Just then Big Gay Al runs
        through the frame, we FOLLOW him as he skips his way around
        gunfire.

<b>                             BIG GAY AL
</b>                   Ooh! Goodness those bullets are going
<b>                   FAST!!!
</b>
        Another bullet zings by his head.

<b>                             BIG GAY AL
</b>                   Jumping Jesus, this is insane!!

        THUMP! A bullet hits Big Gay Al square in the head. More
        bullets follow, tearing him to shreds.

<b>        WIDE ANGLE ON - ENTIRE BATTLE
</b>
        This shot parodies one of the big shots from 'Saving Private
        Ryan'. Just complete overkill. Explosions, helicopters,
        gunfire and death.

        Kyle's mother, and the other mothers as well, stand on a
        ridge overlooking the horrific massacre.

<b>                             STAN'S MOTHER
</b>                   My God... This is terrible...

        Kyle's mother holds out her M-16. She is now completely
        insane.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   This is what we wanted! We wanted our

                   worth fighting the not pretty things for!
                   Why do you think children have to be born
                   in hospitals?

        The other mothers look very confused.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER

                   sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!

        Kyle's mother turns back to the battle. More killing and
        explosions.

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER

                   Kyle wasn't even BORN in a hospital!

        She charges the field.

<b>        EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

        explosions.

<b>                             PHILLIP
</b>                   Come on, we can take shelter in one of

        But just then, Kyle's mother comes charging in with her gun!!

        Phillip spins around just in time to see Kyle's mother
        plunge her bayonet into Terrance's abdomen.

<b>                             TERRANCE

        Blood from Terrance's abdomen slowly spills from his stomach.

        Everything gets SILENT as we follow the blood down, down,
        down...

        Until it hits the ground with a huge, echoing BWOOOMMMM!!!

        CLOSE UP on Kyle's mother's eyes.

        CLOSE UP on the spot of blood on the ground...

<b>        BACK TO REAL TIME
</b>
        Suddenly, the ground starts to open up! FWOOM!! Great flames
        and ash take over the sky.

        Satan and his minions explode from below. Everyone stops
        fighting for a moment, to watch this amazing spectacle.

<b>                             SATAN
</b><b>                   RAAGHGH!!!! MY TIME HAS COME!!!
</b>
        Demons and flames emerge from the ground. All the soldiers on
        both sides can't believe what they're seeing.

        Now out of the giant abyss comes Kenny. He dusts himself off
        and looks around.

<b>        EXT. TRENCH - NIGHT
</b>
        As more bombs and gunshots go off. Kyle, Cartman and Ike
        huddle close to each other in a trench.

        Another explosion rocks the trench. Dirt flies all over the
        boys' heads.

                   for?!

        Cartman tosses Mr. Hat out of the trench. We hear GUNSHOTS
        and then VERY FAINTLY we hear Garrison's voice.

<b>                             MR. GARRISON

        More explosions go off. Dead bodies fly all around the boys.

        More battle. People are dying left and right.

        The Doctor from the Hospital scene runs in with an M-16. A
        Canadian steps in front of him, the doctor shoots, and blows
        the Canadian's head clean off.

        Suddenly, the ticket guy's chest rips open. He falls dead,

        shotgun.

</b>                   I'm glad you got that off your chest.

        Tom the Rhinoplasty surgeon leaps in and stabs the Canadian
        through the head with his bayonet.

<b>                             TOM
</b>                   I guess he got the point.

        A Canadian rushes in and machine guns Tom full of holes.

                   insulator for electrical applications.

        Just as the fighting escalates, Satan and his minions rush
        in.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Yes! Good! Fight and kill one another!

        The soldiers all look scared and puzzled.

<b>                             SATAN

        Kyle's mother backs down, ashamed.

        One by one, the soldiers start to kneel.

        Satan throws his arms up in the air and laughs a horrible,
        deep laugh that fills the world.

        But just then, the ground shakes again. Satan looks over to
        the huge abyss he had crawled out of and notices another
        figure.

        He is burnt horribly, but it is Saddam. He holds a martini
        glass in his hand.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   No! It can't be!

        Saddam, burnt to a crisp, walks over to Satan and grabs his
        ass.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   Did you miss me, buttercup?

                   All right, gang! I am your new ruler now!
                   Everyone bow down to ME!!

        Satan puts his head down.

        Kyle walks up with Cartman, Stan and Kenny.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   And?

        Kenny pulls out the proofs of purchases. TRIUMPHANT MUSIC
        plays.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't
                   just renege on a deal. That's lying.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not
                   hear okay?

        Saddam smacks Satan in the face. Now Satan looks mad, but he
        sits down like a good little bitch.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   Now, let's start torturing people, shall

</b>                   AY!  Don't call me fat, buttfucker-

        ZAP!!  A huge CHARGE shoots from Cartman, knocking one of
        hell's demons on his ass.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!

        ZAP!!! Another huge CHARGE emits from the v-chip inside
        Cartman and sends the other Swedish Soldier reeling.

<b>                             KYLE

        A smile comes across Cartman's face.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b><b>                   BUTTFUCKING SHIT!
</b>
        BZZZZZZZZT!   A huge charge busts the chains that hold
        Cartman's wrists.

        He jumps down.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Yes!

        TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays as Cartman uses his newly found power.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   Quick, Satan!  Do something!

        But before Satan can do anything, Cartman holds up his hands
        and lets loose.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b><b>                   FUCK A HUNK A SHIT, YOU RAT FUCK!!!
</b>
        BZZZZZZZZZAAT!!!!  A charge hits Satan square between the
        eyes and knocks him down.

        He gets to his knees and stands up again.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   Hey, you need to watch your mouth, brat!

<b>                             CARTMAN

        Cartman holds up his hands.

        The charge hits Saddam in the chest.  He drops again.

        Saddam looks around and is suddenly scared.  He appeals to
        Cartman.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   Hey buddy!  No need to stress! Let me
                   make you a deal!  How about a lifetime
                   supply of Snacky Smores and we just
                   forget about this whole thing?!

<b>                             KYLE

        Cartman closes his eyes and hums like he's summoning up the
        worst words in the world.

        Then, it comes out.  Like a volcano.

<b>                             CARTMAN

</b>
<b>        BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZATTTTTTTTT!!!!!
</b>
        A huge purple jolt emerges from each of Cartman's hands and
        joins into one powerful current that hits Saddam.  Saddam is
        thrown back against the wall.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                       (To Satan)
                   What are you waiting for, bitch?! Destroy
                   him!!

        Satan looks at Cartman, then at Saddam, and thinks...

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
</b>                   Come on you weak, stupid cum bucket! Save
                   me!!

        Satan stands there.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Help you? You've destroyed my life and
                   now you want me to help you?!  You're
                   always making me feel like a piece of
                   shit.

                   with respect!  You've never respected me!

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN

</b>                   I don't care!  I want to talk about it
                   now!

        Saddam grabs Satan by the arm.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Ow, you're hurting me!

                   front of my friends!  You know how I get
                   mad when I get embarassed.

        Satan starts getting really mad.  Steam starts coming from
        his nostrils.

<b>                             SADDAM HUSSEIN

        Satan picks up Saddam, and throws him over a huge, flaming
        cliff, back into the depths of hell.

        They all laugh merrily.

        Satan stands over the cliff, looking down at where Saddam
        fell.

<b>                             SATAN

        The boys look at each other, confused.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Saddam didn't respect me.  All he wanted

        Satan turns to the open abyss.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   I must admit, I'm kind of relieved. It's
                   too fucking cold up here.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Aren't there cold parts of hell?

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Yeah, but it's a real dry cold. Here it's
                   the humidity that gets me. I guess I'm
                   destined to live in hell... alone...

        Sadly, Satan walks back down the trench into hell. But
        something catches his eye.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Hello... What's this?

        Satan bends down and picks up Mr. Hat. He looks at it, and
        then places it gently on his hand.

<b>                             SATAN
</b>                   Hi there, little guy... Would you like to
                   go to hell with me?

<b>                             SATAN (AS MR. HAT)
</b>                   Sure. I bet we can be best friends!

        Satan smiles. And walks down to hell with Mr. Hat.

        The boys walks over to Kenny.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Thank you, Kenny.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for
                   us. You're a real pal.

        A bright red light flashes and Satan and his minions are
        dragged back down into hell. Kenny is taken along with them.

        At the same time, Garrison, Jimbo, Mackey and all the others
        who died, suddenly and magically appear. They look at
        themselves, wondering what just happened.

        Everyone just stands around in a daze. Canadians and
        Americans alike look at each other and wonder what to do.

<b>                             MR. GARRISON
</b>                   I... I'm alive... Where's Mr. Hat?

<b>                             BIG GAY AL
</b>                   Wow... We were all killed and now we're
                   fine. That's super!

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Yeah, but you know, I learned something
                   today.  I learned that getting all worked
                   up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is
                   just stupid... You all focused so hard on
                   erasing profanity that you forgot the
                   most important thing... To love each
                   other.

<b>                             CARTMAN
</b>                   Yeah! You're all a bunch of stupid sons a
                   bitches!

        The boys' parents walk up.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going
                   to have fun with profanity just like you
                   and dad did when you were little.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or
                   dicksucker or, or-

<b>                             KYLE'S MOTHER
</b>                   Shiteater-

<b>                             STAN'S MOTHER
</b>                   -Or monkey fucker-

        They all laugh merrily at their naughtiness.

        Wendy walks up to Stan.

<b>                             WENDY
</b>                   I'm sorry Stan, I guess you really DO get
                   it after all!

        Stan smiles. MUSIC swells.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Wendy... How would you like to go get
                   some ice cream?

<b>                             WENDY
</b>                   Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice
                   cream?

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   My friend the clitoris told me.

<b>                             WENDY
</b>                   Wow, I have a clitoris too.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Really? Where the hell do you keep it?
                   It's huge.

        Wendy grabs Stan and plants a big kiss on him. Stan vomits
        into Wendy's mouth.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   But Wendy... What about Gregory?

        Gregory stands off to one side, scowling.

<b>                             WENDY
</b>                   Stan, I never cared for Gregory.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   You didn't?

<b>                             WENDY
</b>                   No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   Cool!

<b>                             WENDY
</b>                       (Singing)
                   <b>Thank my lucky stars
                   Here before me now
                   Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>

<b>                             STAN
</b>                   <b>Knew it in a word
                   Saw it in a glance
                   The only thing I think I'd die for</b>

<b>                             STAN AND WENDY
</b>                   <b>I can't stop now... My heart's

                   I pray your arms my arms to take!
                   So this is why I'm alive!</b>

        Now everyone joins hands and starts singing-

<b>                             EVERYONE
</b>                   <b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE, UNCLEFUCKA!

</b><b>                   NOBODY FUCKS UNCLES QUITE LIKE YOU!
</b>                   UNCLEFUCKAAA!!!</b>

        Kenny's mom and dad come up.

<b>                             KENNY'S DAD
</b>                   This is all so wonderful.  I just wish
                   our little Kenny could see all of this
                   joy.

<b>                             KYLE
</b>                   Oh he can, dude.  Look!

        Kyle points to the sky.  Everyone looks up just in time to
        see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky.

        We follow the shooting star and then slowly ZOOM in on it.
        As we get closer, we realize it is actually Kenny, shooting
        towards the heavens.
<b>   
</b>        As TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays, Kenny's little body floats up and
        up through the clouds. (NOTE:  This will also be done in 3-D
<b>        CGI)
</b>
        Rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into
        the warmth of the baby blueness.

        Angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings.  They smile
        gently.  He feels calm.  He feels good.

        Amidst a group of angels, Kenny flies upwards and finally...
        into Heaven.
