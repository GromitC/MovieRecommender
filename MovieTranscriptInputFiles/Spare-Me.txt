<b>						FADE IN
</b>
<b>1     BLACK						    1
</b>
The screen is black. Thunder rumbles.

<b>		THEO (VO)
</b>	When you hear thunder...

A black bowling ball pulls away from the lens. The ball is in
the hands of THEO SKINNER, an intense, handsome 28 year old
man with sideburns dressed in worn bowling attire.

<b>		THEO (VO)
</b>	...God is bowling.

He holds the ball in front of him, wristbrace on, his face a
study in concentration.

</b>
<b>2     EXT. BRIDGE - DAY				     2
</b>
An empty causeway spans a bay somewhere along the south shore
of Long Island. The sky is overcast. SHEILA, a woman in her
late twenties, wearing a full length heliotrope pleather coat
over a waitress outfit, kneels in the middle of the road. A
souped-up Vespa motor scooter stands nearby.

<b>KEN AND BARBIE
</b>
Sheila holds a Bridal Barbie and Ken doll set. She sets them
down on the road, pulls out a can of lighter fluid and soaks
the dolls. She pulls out a bowling pin-shaped lighter and
torches the nuptial tableau.

<b>3     INT. THEO'S CAR				       3
</b>
Theo drives his ratty old American car along a highway. The
car has Ohio plates. He sucks coffee from a 7-Eleven "Big-
Swig" cup and examines a map. A yellow plastic "Bowler on
Board" sign is stuck to a side window. Theo's music PLAYS.
His eyes nod off, then snap awake.

<b>4     NIGHTMARE						4
</b>
The screen is black, except for three circles in the middle
of the screen. The light shining through them is snuffed out
by three large pink objects. There is a loud POP, like a

thumb being pulled out of a tight hole.

<b>		BOWLING BALL
</b>	A slow motion low tracking shot of a
	bowling ball hitting a polished lane.

<b>		BOWLING PINS
</b>	Close-up of the milky white surface of
	two bowling pins on opposite sides of the
	lane - a seven-ten split. The RUMBLING
	ball is heard in the distance like a
	furious hulking steamroller of doom. The
	pins begin to tremble, and then transform
	into a Bridal Ken and Barbie. The dolls
	burst into flame.

<b>		BALL
</b>	The ball blasts past the camera and
	metamorphoses into Theo's car.

<b>				   RAPID DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>5     EXT. BRIDGE					 5
</b>
Theo's sedan blasts past the camera down the empty road.

<b>		BURNING DOLLS
</b>	The flaming couple stand in the middle of
	the bridge. Theo's car hits the pair and
	they fly into the air in slow-motion. A
	distant SOUND of pins scattering is
	heard. The two dolls smoke as they spin
	into the sky, then hit the water with
	dual HISSES.

<b>				        DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>6     PIN RESET MACHINERY				   6
</b>
An American Machine and Foundry pin reset machine performs
its functions like a mechanical ballet as the camera follows
a bowling ball through its journey. The "Spare Me!" theme
MUSIC (similar to "Balboa Blue" by the Marketts) swells.
TITLE: SPARE ME! appears on the bowling ball. Pins tumble
across the back plate, are loaded into the pin conveyor,
lifted up to the crown feeder, distributed into the rotating
carousel, and then set down in perfect formation upon the
polished bowling alley.

BURN-IN PRINCIPAL PLAYER TITLES. Titles appear on the pins.
The ball trundles along the return trough straight into the
lens.

<b>BLACK
</b>
<b>7     INT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY				   7
</b>
A muzak cover of 'Broke, Busted, and Disgusted' PLAYS in the
background as Theo gingerly pulls a hot taco out of the
microwave oven. ALFIE, the rickety old man who runs the
store, shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping
it down. Theo pokes at the taco with a spork as steam rises.
He pulls a disgusted grimace. Alfie pours himself a cup of
coffee and then attempts to open a tiny container of half &
half. Because his hands are shaking so much, the cream goes
everywhere but into the coffee.

<b>		ALFIE
</b>	I'm an addict. I can't go through a day
	without the stuff. Theo reaches over and
	pours for him with a steady hand.

<b>		ALFIE
</b>	You're not from around here, are you?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'm from Akron.

Alfie looks at Theo's bowling shoe attired feet.

<b>		ALFIE
</b>	You a bowler?

Theo's hand starts shaking uncontrollably. He puts down the
cream.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'm looking for a man.

<b>		ALFIE
</b>	What kind of man?

<b>		THEO
</b>	A bowler.

Alfie presses a matchbook into Theo's hand and then trundles
off. Theo looks down at the matchbook; it reads "Bowl for
health, enjoy yourself. Babylon Lanes."

<b>8     EXT. BABYLON LANES - TWILIGHT			   8
</b>
Theo pulls into the empty parking lot of Babylon Lanes beside
a cheap looking American sedan.

<b>9     INT. BABYLON LANES				    9
</b>
Theo walks into an empty run-down forty lane bowling alley
carrying his ball bag. It is dark. The fluorescent lights
switch on and the pin re-set machines whirr into action. SID
and BREEZE, two shady looking guys in a basement-sale suits
walk up lane dividers towards Theo.

<b>		SID
</b>	Lane's closed big fellah, league night.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'm not here to bowl.

<b>		SID
</b>		(gesturing to Theo's bag)
	You drag that coconut around for your
	health, or do you know how to use it?

<b>		THEO
</b>		(bristling at the challenge)
	I'm looking for somebody.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?

<b>		SID
</b>	No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'm looking for Buzz Fazeli.

Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.

<b>		SID
</b>	What do you want with old man Faz?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Some unfinished business.

<b>		SID
</b>	If you wanna do business in this town,
	there's other people around here got more
	weight than old Faz.

A lady dwarf walks by.

<b>		DWARF
</b>	Evening Sid, evening Breeze.

<b>		SID
</b>	Evening Tina.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Good luck tonight Tina.

Tina opens a door and goes down some stairs.

<b>		THEO
</b>	You guys got something going on
	downstairs?

<b>		SID
</b>	We provide some extracurricular
	activities for the senior citizens in the
	community.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Basement bingo?

Breeze sniggers into his hand

<b>		SID
</b>		(smirks)
	Yeah, basement bingo.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Lemme see your ball.

Breeze grabs Theo's bag.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Let go of my bag.

Sid sidles around behind Theo who tries to keep him in sight.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.

<b>		SID
</b>	You afraid we're gonna steal it?

Breeze unzips the bag and pulls the ball out. Theo's temper
is rising, he breathes deeply. He is obviously making a
Herculean effort to keep himself in check.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I said, let go of my bag.

With lightning speed Theo's hand shoots out and grabs the
middle fingers on Sid's right hand. Sid howls in agony.

<b>		SID
</b>	Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!

<b>		THEO
</b>	Tell your little pal to let go.

<b>		SID
</b>	Breeze, give him his ball back!

Breeze, astonished, drops Theo's ball into the bag. Sid
cringes in front of Theo.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge,
	past the Peter Pan, last house on the
	dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid
	drops to his knees and cradles his
	damaged hand.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.

<b>		THEO
</b>	It belonged to my dad.

Theo turns and walks out.

<b>10     EXT. WOODS - NIGHT				   10
</b>
JUNIOR, a dumpy man in his late thirties with a rat tail, bad
skin and wearing a white straitjacket and fluorescent orange
pants, runs desperately through dark woods. Bloodhounds BARK
in the distance.

<b>11     EXT. ROAD - NIGHT				    11
</b>
Theo drives over the draw-bridge and past the Peter Pan Diner
with its huge neon sign.

<b>12     EXT. DEAD END STREET				 12
</b>
Theo's car pulls up in front of a modest suburban house. A
rooftop weather vane in the shape of a bowler CREAKS
ominously in the wind.

<b>13     EXT. BUZZ'S HOUSE				    13
</b>
Theo rings the doorbell. The porch light comes on, and
MILLIE, a fifty-five year-old woman dressed for a night on
the town in Reno, but with fuzzy slippers and a hairnet,
opens the door. A miniscule neurotic poodle leaps at Theo's
bowling ball bag, YAPPING and snapping at it.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Is Mr. Fazeli in please?

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	Who wants to know?
		(to dog)
	Zeus!

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'm a bowler.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	I'm sick of you people. Why don't you
	leave him be?

<b>		BUZZ (OS)
</b>	Let him in, Millie. And don't frisk him.

<b>14     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM			 14
</b>
Millie and Theo, with Zeus hot on his trail, enter the room.
BUZZ FAZELI, a sixty-five year-old man shaped a lot like a
compressed bowling pin, slouches in a recliner. The room is
decorated with trophies of Buzz's bygone pro-bowling halcyon
days.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I
	leave the door wide open. Let the parade
	begin!

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Clam it!

Millie is silent. Buzz gets up and approaches Zeus.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Hey, rat. C'mere.

Zeus growls at Buzz as he comes nearer, then clamps onto his
sleeve and hangs from his arm, growling ferociously. In one
smooth motion, Buzz flings the rabid poodle through an open
window and into the night.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	Jerk.

She heads outside.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Sit down.

Theo sits on the edge of the couch. Buzz puts out his hand.
Theo shakes it.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Buzz Fazeli.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Theo.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I know your face, you're an up-and-comer.
	You bowl on the tour.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'm not on the tour this year.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(nods understandingly)
	Need some advice, huh.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress
	says I'm a thorn in their side.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(dismissive wave)
	Don't worry about the Congress, they're
	just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.

<b>15     EXT. THEO'S CAR				      15
</b>
Millie's furry slippers protrude from the driver's side door.
Zeus chews furiously on the yellow plastic 'Bowler On Board'
sign. She rifles through the contents of the overstuffed
glove compartment. She notices her dog.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>		(under her breath)
	Get that outta your mouth!

<b>16     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM			 16
</b>
<b>		THEO
</b>	They suspended me.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Why'd they suspend you?

Theo's eyes glaze over, the lights in the room dim, and Buzz
seems to recede into the far distance.

<b>17     TV SCREEN - FLASHBACK				17
</b>
In ultra-slow scan we see an image of two bowlers, one is
smiling cockily to off-screen fans and waving, the other is
Theo, his face filled with hate, winding up to smash the
other man in the head with his bowling ball.

<b>		THEO (VO)
</b>	It wasn't really my fault.

In the far background the hollow booming VOICE of a judge
delivers sentence.

<b>		JUDGE (VO)
</b>	The American Bowling Congress hereby
	suspends Theo Maynard Skinner from all
	professional bowling activities within
	the jurisdiction of the American Bowling
	Congress and its international co-
	signers... The ball mashes into the
	smirking mans head, causing it to snap
	forward. The judge's gavel BANGS and the
	crowd ROARS.

<b>18     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM			 18
</b>
Theo snaps out of it, the room lights come up, and Buzz leans
in.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I got suspended when I was young, too. I
	was pretty cocky in my day.

<b>		THEO
</b>	They suspended me for 100 years.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	100 years!
		(knits his brow)

<b>		THEO
</b>	I can appeal in five. I was hoping you
	could help me Mr. Fazeli.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(uneasy)
	What do you think I can do?

<b>		THEO
</b>		(sweating slightly)
	I need a sponsor to get my sanction card
	back. Where I come from, you're the king.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy
	could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't
	do any good for me to talk to the
	Congress.
		(briskly changing subject)
	Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I've never had orange whips, I'm from
	Akron.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>19     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, KITCHEN				 19
</b>
Millie and Buzz are in the kitchen, talking in loud whispers.
Millie fills a blender while Buzz cuts oranges.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	He's the guy Buzz.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the
	whips.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	I looked in his car. He's got pictures of
	you, clippings, maps.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Bowlers don't go around killing other
	bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll
	give him some tips and an autograph and
	he's outta here.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz?
	You're doing something dangerous in that
	alley.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Millie, I know what I'm doing.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	We should leave this town. I can't take
	this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill
	you in my house.

<b>20     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM			 20
</b>
Buzz rejoins Theo in the living room.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You
	had a seven-ten split in the final frame.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it.
	The toughest shot on the last frame.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	That game was before you was born.

<b>		THEO
</b>	My mom was there. She told me about it.
	The 'Fazeli Split.'

<b>21     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, KITCHEN				 21
</b>
The blender is wailing at high speed as Millie throws in a
whole box of laxative, a can of Drano and a jar of pills. Her
hands are trembling.

<b>22     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM			 22
</b>
Millie walks into the living room with a silver tray holding
two orange whips; one thick and deadly, the other thin and
safe. There is laughter coming from both men.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	And the irony is, thirty years later,
	that prick is bowling in the seniors on
	TV all over the world, and look at me. Ah
	well. The docs made me stop, on account
	of my ticker.
		(taps his chest)
	I don't really miss it, but then...
		(chokes up)
	...I miss it.

He spies Millie approaching with the tray.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods.
	Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so
	that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo
	takes the other glass.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Thanks.

<b>		ZEUS
</b>	Zeus is on the sofa, GROWLING and tugging
	at Theo's bowling bag. The bag rips apart
	and the ball hits the floor.

<b>		ORANGE WHIP
</b>	Theo brings the drink to his lips. The
	ball rolls across the room.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	The ball rolls into Buzz's feet.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	This your lucky bullet?

Buzz picks it up and reads the writing on the ball. He snaps
a look into the kitchen, seeing the empty Drano and laxative
cartons. Buzz slams the drink away from Theo's lips. The
drink explodes across the room. Buzz is up on his feet.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(with intensity)
	Where'd you get this ball?

<b>		THEO
</b>		(stunned - looks at the mess on
		 the floor, then at Buzz)
	It's mine.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Who gave it to you?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Grace Skinner.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(astonished)
	Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to
	you?

<b>		THEO
</b>	She's my mom.

Theo stands and takes the ball from Buzz's hands. Buzz is in
shock, staring at Theo.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(regaining his voice)
	Who are you? Who sent you here?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'm your son. You're a hard father to
	find.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	Son?

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(to Millie)
	Millie, please.
		(to Theo)
	I don't have a son.
	I think you better leave now young man.
	Buzz gestures towards the front door.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(calmly)
	Grace Skinner Fazeli, you must remember
	her?

Buzz takes Theo by the elbow to eject him from the house.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I don't know no Grace Skinner.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(pulls his arm away)
	You knew her. You married her in 1963.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	Married?

Buzz grabs a large bowling trophy and waves it at Theo.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	You're a bullshit artist, that's what you
	are. You got no right to be here! Theo
	yanks the trophy away from Buzz.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I got a right. You're my father.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I ain't nobody's father!

Theo hurls the trophy at Buzz. He ducks and the trophy sails
into a large glass trophy case. Broken glass and trophies fly
everywhere.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>		(noticing Zeus)
<b>	ZEUS!
</b>
Zeus is laid out cold near the spilled orange whip on the
living room floor. Millie hunches over her comatose poodle.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	My poor baby!

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(to Theo)
	You see what you did?
		(he picks up the ball)
	Take your ball and get out.

Theo takes the ball and exits the house.

<b>23     EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT				  23
</b>
Theo, bathed in sweat, practices his release form with
obsessive determination. He is alone near the empty bridge.
Sheila spies on him from behind the bridge control booth.
Theo takes a long slug from a bottle of liquor. He hears a
motor scooter start and ROAR off into the night.

<b>24     INT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY				  24
</b>
Theo stands at the self-serve island sipping coffee. A muzak
cover of 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' PLAYS.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(resignedly)
	99 years, 241 days,
		(looks at his watch)
	15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling.
	Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve
	island and begins wiping it down.

<b>		ALFIE
</b>	Find your bowler?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't
	the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying
	to affix the lid on his cup, but his
	hands are trembling, spilling some of the
	coffee.

<b>		ALFIE
</b>	My father used to say to me "Never..."
	no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...
		(puzzles)
	Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Maybe I should have left the ball in the
	car.

<b>25     EXT. BUZZ'S HOUSE - DAY				    25
</b>
Millie kneels on the front lawn patting dirt down on a little
grave marked by a wooden cross. Theo walks up.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	He's not here.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>		(points to grave)
	This is a sign! Someone's coming to take
	Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're
	the guy or what, but I'm not letting it
	happen. I'm leaving him first.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help.
	Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the
	trunk of her car.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but
	himself.

<b>		THEO
</b>	He's my father, Millie.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	He's no father to you.

Theo lifts a box full of new bowling pins into the trunk.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	Careful with that one. He won't tell me
	anything, but I know there's something
	strange going on over at the lanes. If
	you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to
	die.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Where can I find him?

<b>		MILLIE
</b>		(looks at her watch)
	The Peter Pan.

Millie gets into the car.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>	You tell Buzz I went to my sister's in
	Ronkonkoma. Oh, I'm sorry about trying to
	kill you last night, Theo. It was nothing
	personal. Millie puts on a pair of
	sunglasses and patches out in a cloud of
	gravel and dust.

<b>26     INT. PETER PAN DINER - DAY				 26
</b>
A blender WHIRRS. Sheila, in her waitress uniform, carefully
chops something.
She watches an indoor motocross rally on the diner's color
TV. 12-PACK, a hefty construction worker, sits at the
counter.

<b>		12-PACK
</b>	Hey Sheila, how's that orange whip
	comin'?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>		(mimicking him under her
		 breath)
	How's that orange whip comin'?

THWAP! Sheila is dismembering a Ken doll with a big knife.
She scoops the parts into the blender and switches from pur�e
to frapp�.

<b>		12-PACK
</b>	So, I heard Junior busted out again?

Sheila puts the glass down in front of 12-Pack with a THUNK.

<b>		12-PACK
</b>	Hey Sheila, you can whip my oranges
	anytime. Sheila puts a Barbie head
	earring on her left ear. Buzz comes into
	the diner and slides into a booth. Sheila
	walks over with a pot of coffee.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Cup of joe Mr. Fazeli?

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't
	sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a
	cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his
	hands trembling.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you
	need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of
	Theo pulling into the parking lot. She
	puts a Ken head earring in her right ear.
	Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(groans)
	Some people will do anything for an
	autograph. Theo enters the diner and
	walks over to Buzz.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Millie left to stay with her sister in
	Ronkonkoma.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	You know what a mixer ball is? It's like
	you, you come out of nowhere and upset
	things, scattering everything all over.
	Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.

<b>		THEO
</b>	What are you doing over at the lanes
	that's so dangerous, Buzz?

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	You shouldn't listen to her, she's a
	nervous old Nellie.

<b>		THEO
</b>	She thinks someone's trying to kill you.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I couldn't pay someone enough to try to
	kill me. Sheila comes over to take their
	orders.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I'll have my usual please, Sheila.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't
	introduced me to your fan.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Sheila, meet...uh...
		(leans in to Theo,
		 sardonically)
	I forget the name.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(uncomfortably)
	Theo.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's
	daughter.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>		(eyeing Theo up and down)
	You look like you're something on the
	lanes.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Theo's bowled on the tour.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?

<b>		THEO
</b>	What's your specialty?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Whips...orange whips.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Then I'll have the number four with one
	of your finest whips.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	How do you want it?
		(their eyes meet)
	The eggs.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(discomfited at the blatant
		 double entendre)
	Uh...over easy.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Coming right up.

Sheila smiles and walks away. Theo watches her slink behind
the counter.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Watch out for that one. She's got a great
	average, but she's looking for a prince.
	And, believe me, she's
		(more)

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	kissed a lotta tadpoles.
		(looking Theo in the eye)
	Listen, I been thinking about your
	problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you.
	It would be unethical. But, there is
	something I could do for you.
		(leans in, secretively)
	Putt-putt golf.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Putt-putt golf?

Buzz pulls a golf ball from his pocket, flashes it and slips
it back.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	It's the next level, the next
	dimension...
		(deep conviction)
	...the small ball.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(in Buzz's spell)
	The small ball.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	It's gonna be bigger than big. Think
	Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room
	for real golf courses in Japan.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(snapping out of it)
	Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies
	are my kind of people. Sheila steps over
	to the booth with their food. The Buzz
	Burger has three holes cut in the middle
	to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz
	sees the two sleazeballs park their car
	and walk towards the diner.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(pondering the thought)
	Maybe I could bowl in Japan.

Buzz stands up abruptly.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I gotta wash up.

Buzz heads for the rest rooms. The door opens with a JINGLE.

<b>		SID
</b>	Three whips. To go.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	When you get a chance.

Sid and Breeze walk over to Theo's booth and slide in. Sid's
middle fingers are taped to an aluminum splint. The BLENDER
kicks into action. Buzz watches the group from the bathroom
hall and tries to catch the conversation.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Hey, you still here?

<b>		SID
</b>	We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's
	favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the
	plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and
	pulls his burger away from Sid.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Get away from that burger.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Sorry Faz, we didn't know you was here.

<b>		SID
</b>	Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>		(to Theo and Buzz)
	Are you guys bruddas?

The booth party is silent for a moment. Theo LAUGHS.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	No, we ain't brothers.

<b>		SID
</b>	You know why we call him Breeze?

Sid puts a hand near Breezes left ear and blows into Breeze's
right ear. He makes fluttering motions with his hand as if
wind was hitting it. Breeze's face breaks into a smile as he
pushes Sid away.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm
	serious! You guys are related, right?

<b>		THEO
</b>	He's my dad.

Buzz flashes a warning glare to Theo. Sid grabs some of
Buzz's french fries.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(slapping his hand)
	Get your own.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	See that, toldja Sid. I knew I seen a
	resemblance.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Why don't you clowns get your whips and
	get lost.

<b>		SID
</b>	Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual
	charismatic self today when he told us to
	tell you...
		(gazing artfully upwards and
		 rubbing his chin)
	What was that he said...?

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't
	like no sticky fingers in the till.

<b>		SID
</b>		(exasperated)
	Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.

Sheila comes over and PLUNKS down the three whips-to-go.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>		(to Sheila)
	Your pop said to put these on his tab.
	Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards
	the door.

<b>		SID
</b>	So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is
	waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and
	steps between his father and the two
	sleazeballs.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'm coming with you.

Sid shies away from Theo, protecting his hand.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Easy. I got business to do, Theo. I'll
	come back and haunt you later.
		(drops a twenty on the table,
		 pats Theo's cheek)
	Don't say I never gave you nothing.

Buzz goes outside with a sleazeball on either side. Sheila
takes the twenty dollar bill. Theo grabs his jacket and makes
for the door.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(to Sheila)
	Do those two work for your dad or mine?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Mine, and they never tip.

The sleazeballs hustle Buzz into the front seat of their car
and patch out.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Do you know where they're taking him?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there
	for my dad. Everybody who has anything to
	do with bowling in this town answers to
	my dad. Theo splits.

<b>27     EXT. WOODS - DAY				     27

Junior is running at breakneck speed through the thick brush.
Bloodhounds BARK. Junior slows down and drops to his knees,
gasping for breath. He looks up to the sky. The camera pushes
up to his sweaty, tortured face.

<b>		JUNIOR

<b>	SHEILA!
</b>
<b>28     INT. BABYLON LANES, BUZZ'S OFFICE		        28
</b>
MILES KASTLE lounges in a cheap chair behind Buzz's desk
toying with one of those motorized wire balancing sculptures
they have in airport souvenir concessions. He is a carefully
groomed middle-aged low-budget version of Hugh Hefner in an
acrylic sweatsuit with 'Miles 'O' Lanes' embroidered on the
front. Sid and Breeze push Buzz into the room. Buzz is poker
faced.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Buzz.

Buzz nods.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(to Breeze)
	You got my whip?

Breeze pulls the third whip out of a bag and gives it to him.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(motions to Sid and Breeze)
	Lose yourselves.

Sid and Breeze leave the room. Buzz goes to a locker and
begins changing into a flashy MC outfit.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	What's on your mind, Miles?

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	We've been partners a long time now,
	haven't we Buzz?

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Seven years.

Kastle pokes a straw into the whip and takes a long drag.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	This scam we got going here was your
		(more)

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it
	was a rotten idea, but I put up the
	scratch.
		(pulls a smile)
	And now we got a beautiful thing.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	It's a beautiful thing.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz?
	You know what we got? Buzz raises an
	eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.

<b>		MILES
</b>	We got balance.

Kastle flicks the little wire man. It bobs and sways.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	A partnership is a very delicate balance.
	But let's say something tips the scales,
	maybe one partner takes more than his
	share, then... Kastle tips the wire man
	off his perch. The little motor squeals
	pathetically.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	... oops. We got no more balance.

Buzz looks on with narrowed eyes as he adjusts his cravat.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	And look at that; both partners go down
	together. Kastle shoves the sculpture
	onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it
	under his heel. He goes over and puts his
	arm around Buzz.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Simple math, Buzz.
		(he holds up his fingers)
	Two plus two does not equal three.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Miles, I've always been on the square
	with you.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	I'm sure you have Buzz.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Wish me luck.

Buzz jogs out into a spotlight.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Break a leg...
		(sneers)
	...partner.

<b>29     INT. DWARF BOWLING ALLEY				   29
</b>
APPLAUSE erupts as Buzz appears in the spotlight. The dwarf
bowling alley is a pungently smoke-filled room peopled with
shady, washed-up bowlers sitting in chairs behind a bowling
lane. The old-timers are shouting and pounding shots.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(over the PA)
	Greetings, ladies, gentlemen.
		(the place grows silent)
	My dentist told me this one the other
	day: How many bowlers does it take to
	screw in a lightbulb?

<b>		AUDIENCE
</b>	How many?

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	It takes three bowlers to screw in a
	lightbulb. One to hold the bulb, one to
	turn the ladder, and one to hold their
	balls. Thank you, thank you. Just throw
	money.

<b>						CUT TO:

<b>30     EXT. BABYLON LANES - EVENING			   30

Theo drives through the full parking lot of Babylon Lanes. He
pulls around the back and sees dark figures slip into a back
door. He parks his car, walks over to the now closed door.
It's locked. Theo finds another entrance and sneaks in. He
creeps his way through the darkened alley towards the sound
of raucous partying.

<b>		BUZZ (OS)
</b>	Welcome to Buzz Fazeli's Dwarf Bowling,
	folks, where we bring you the finest in
	specialized bowling entertainment.

<b>		THEO'S POV
</b>	Through a crack in a door Theo can see
	Buzz standing in the spotlight.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I would like to draw your attention to
	the top of the lane.
		(a Casio drum roll PLAYS)
	Weighing in at sixty-nine pounds and
	standing exactly three feet - the
	diminutive dominatrix Teeny Weenie Tina
	the Terrible! The crowd CHEERS as the
	spotlight moves to Tina, a masked lady
	dwarf duded up in a combination black
	leather and cowhide western style S&M
	outfit. She CRACKS a whip and leers at
	the bowlers. They HOWL with excitement.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Don't be shy, folks!

Tina straps into her customized skateboard. A drunken
customer forks over a wad of bills, steps up and grabs hold
of the mini-human projectile.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	And - bowl 'er!

Tina is hurled head-first towards the pins. The crowd goes
wild.

<b>		TINA'S POV
</b>	The camera tracks low behind Tina as she
	crashes into the pins.

<b>31     INT. BABYLON LANES, BATHROOM			   31

Theo sneaks into an empty bathroom. He hears voices and ducks
into a stall. Sid and Breeze shove Buzz into the room.

<b>		SID
</b>	Seems to me like you ain't got much
	choice Buzz.

Sid shoves Buzz over to Breeze, Breeze shoves him back.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	You're between Miles Kastle and a hard
	place.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Aaay, hands off the tux!

Sid checks under the stalls, sees Theo's feet and whips open
the door.

<b>		SID
</b>	The busyboy!

Sid yanks Theo out.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Get your hands off me, you moron.

Theo tries to free himself from Sid's grip. He turns to Buzz.

<b>		THEO
</b>	What the fuck is this?

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	What's it look like to you?

<b>		THEO
</b>	It looks like dwarf bowling.

<b>		SID
</b>	Very good, busyboy.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(with intensity)
	Dwarf bowling's illegal.

<b>		SID
</b>		(sarcastically)
	What are you gonna do, call the bowling
	police?

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Heh, heh, heh.

<b>		THEO
</b>	You said it would be unethical to help
	me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I do what I gotta do to survive.

<b>		THEO
</b>	You have no right to call yourself a
	bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be.
	I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking
	anyone to bail me out.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'm your blood.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	You wish!

Theo pushes Buzz up against a stack of boxes full of new
bowling pins. Sid and Breeze hover behind them.

<b>		THEO
</b>	You knew she was pregnant.

Buzz reaches inside a box and pulls out a pin. He waves it
threateningly at Theo.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	What makes you so sure it was me? She
	coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes
	Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men
	struggle for the pin.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Don't say that about my mom!

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I had a career. She wanted a little
	bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap
	into the fray, prying the two men apart.
	They wrestle Theo against a wall,
	pressing his face into the tiles.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Fuck you and fuck bowling.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	That's a laugh. You're all strung out.
	You're a bowling junkie.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I don't need the stinking pro-tour.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	You're dead without the pro-tour, and you

	Breeze punch Theo in the face.

Theo is dragged through the dwarf alley crowd. He has blood
on his face. Half dazed, he looks up at all the distorted
leering faces that peer down at him. The crowd cat-calls and
laughs at Theo.

<b>33     EXT. BABYLON LANES, PARKING LOT - EVENING		33

Theo is thrown onto the asphalt. Sid kicks Theo.

<b>		SID
</b>	You shoulda taken our advice, busyboy.

<b>34     EXT. PETER PAN DINER - DAY				 34
</b>
Theo sits in his parked car outside the Peter Pan diner.
Squinting in the bright light, he examines the cuts on his
face in the sideview mirror. He is looking scruffier. He sees
Sheila come out of the diner, start her scooter, and pull out
into traffic. He follows her.

<b>35     EXT. BRIDGE					35
</b>
He follows the Vespa at a discreet distance as Sheila drives
over the bridge. The weather is windy and threatening.
Thunder RUMBLES.

<b>36     EXT. MILES 'O' LANES				 36
</b>
Theo pulls in next to Sheila's scooter under the big neon
sign for Miles 'O' Lanes Bowling Center. With a huge CLAP of
thunder and the SOUND of falling pins, the skies release a
pounding downpour.

<b>37     KEN AND BARBIE, MACRO C.U.				 37

Sheila's Vespa is parked in the handicapped space. The dolls
are wired to the headset of the scooter. Large droplets of
rain roll down their faces.

<b>38     INT. MILES 'O' LANES				 38
</b>
Theo walks into an ultramodern eighty-lane bowling center,
bowling bag in hand.
A huge banner reads 'Mothers and Daughters Bowl Free
Tonight!' The entire place is filled with pairs of moms and
their daughters - bowling away in matching bowling attire. A
three year-old girl stands staring at Theo.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Hello.

<b>		LITTLE GIRL
</b>	Waaaaaaaaah!

A mom grabs the little girl and whisks her away. Theo surveys
the alley and catches sight of Sheila bowling at the far end
of the alley.

<b>39     LANE, SHEILA & LUNA				  39
</b>
Sheila bowls with LUNA, a 30-ish black guy dressed in a Miles
'O' Lanes jumpsuit and wearing extensions in his hair. Sheila
prods her friend when she sees Theo.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Luna, that's the guy. I saw him do this
	spooky bowling rain dance on the bridge.

<b>		LUNA
</b>	Typical.

Theo walks over. Sheila presents Theo with her ball.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a
	seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane
	and sees the two pins standing.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'm not here to - I can't...

Sheila can't release the ball from Theo's now-paralytic grip.

<b>		SHEILA

	Bowling block.

</b>	Nah, he won't do it.

</b>	It's not an "Alley". I hate when people
	call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so
	common! I prefer "Bowling Center".

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	What's this guy here for, anyway?

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Maybe he's here to pay his last respects.

<b>		SID
</b>	Someone gonna get kacked, boss?

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on
	dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him
	and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze
	look sideways at each other.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	I hired you rent-a-thugs to keep tabs on
	the Faz. I want you all over him like a
	tent. Find out how that little weasel's
	ripping me off. Buzz Fazeli's gonna blow
	the lid off dwarf bowling!

<b>41     LANE, SHEILA & THEO				  41
</b>
The two of them sit together behind the lanes.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I came here to have a word with your dad.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	What do you want with my dad?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Business.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Won't your father help you with that?

<b>		THEO
</b>		(shakes his head)
	Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's
	cracked up to be.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Your dad's one of the only nice people in
	this fucking town. My Dad is slime.
	Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and
	shakes Kastle's proffered hand.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting
	you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't
	come and see me sooner.

<b>		THEO
</b>	You know who I am?

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling
	ball in this town without Miles Kastle
	knowing about it. You don't mind if I
	have a word with Theo, do you bunny?
	Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls
	him away.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	I heard you've been having a little
	trouble with the Congress.
		(waves at a mother/daughter
		 couple)
	Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle
	walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.

<b>		THEO
</b>	You might say I'm at the top of their
	shit list.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Maybe I can help you.
		(calling to a young bowler)
	Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get
	hurt with that big ball, honey.
		(to Theo)
	I've seen tapes of you bowling on the
	circuit. You got Fazeli blood running
	through you. Your pop was a genuine
	talent in his day.

<b>		THEO
</b>	What's with the bad air between you two,
	Mr. Kastle?

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(dismissive gesture)
	It's nothing, just a slight business
	imbalance.
		(to a seated mother)
	How's Gloria's thumb?

<b>		MOTHER (OC)
</b>	The blister's worse than last week.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	No pain, no gain! Keep trying the ice.
	Chin up, sweetie.
		(turning to Theo)
	This place is a bowling oasis.

<b>		THEO
</b>	It's very...clean.

They pause and Kastle waves to some bowlers.

<b>		MRS. JACKSON (OC)
</b>	Hello, Mr.Kastle.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Hello, Violet. How's my favorite
	'bowlerina' doing?

<b>		MRS. JACKSON (OC)
</b><b>	132, 154.
</b>
<b>		KASTLE
</b>	You keep that up Carmelita and one day
	you'll be a champion just like Mr.
	Skinner here. What do you think, Theo?
	Think Carmelita's got the stuff?

<b>		THEO
</b>	That's some pinfall. Almost a 133
	average. Her ball's flat, she needs to
	work on her spin control.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	That's right, didn't you have a slight
	control problem in a recent
	tournament,champ?
		(to Carmelita)
	Now go take out your "big four", darling.
		(to Theo)
	Come on, we're making her nervous.

They continue walking.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	I get them while they're young. Builds
	loyalty.

<b>		MRS. JACKSON (OC)
</b>	She hit it, Mr. Kastle!

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(waving over his shoulder)
	Four or five years when a girl like
	that's bowling on the pro tour for Team
	Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on
	my investment.

<b>		THEO
</b>	And the dwarf bowling?

They stop, and Kastle pulls Theo over to an enormous aquarium
near the lounge.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(making sweeping gesture)
	Think of this business like a big
	aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to
	eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies
	can swim free at the top.
		(more)

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Profits down there, philanthropy up here.
		(looks at Theo)
	Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Nice set-up.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	If it springs a leak, it'll be because
	Buzz is making waves.

<b>		THEO
</b>	What if he wants to get out?

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(chuckles)
	He's earned an early retirement.
		(sprays his mouth with Binaca)
	But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is
	history. Lets talk about your future.
		(puts his arm around Theo)
	I wanna show you something.

<b>42     INT. MILES KASTLE'S OFFICE				 42
</b>
Kastle and Theo stand in front of the huge bank of video
screens.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate,
	Computerize. That, my boy, is the future.
	One of the monitors shows a little girl
	bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it
	barely tips over the first pin. Kastle
	hits a key and the pins explode in an
	emphatic strike. The little girl jumps
	with joy.

<b>		THEO
</b>	What ever happened to just bowling?

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	There's a lot of competition for
	amusement out there. You gotta adapt to
	survive.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I like the sport the way it is.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	A guy like you could breathe some fire
	into bowling. You got ambition like
	a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what
	you want and anything that gets in your
	way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.
		(puts his arm around Theo)
	Maybe lady fate washed you up on my
	doorstep for your own good.
		(pauses for effect)
	I think I could help you, Theo.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(he's been waiting for this)
	How Mr. Kastle?

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	You need a sponsor; I have influence. I
	could sponsor you.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Why would you help me?

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.

Kastle turns to his video screens.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	But, now that you mention it, you could
	afford me one minor dispensation. Theo
	follows his gaze to the screen.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	While you're in town, I need you to keep
	an eye on my daughter for a couple of
	days. Her big brother broke out of the
	mental hospital... Theo's eyes glaze
	over, the lights in the office dim, and
	Kastle seems to recede into the far
	distance.

<b>43     THEO'S POV - NIGHTMARE				     43
</b>
As running FOOTSTEPS are heard, the camera whizzes down a
darkened alley towards the pins.

<b>		KASTLE (OS)
</b>	...and I want someone watching out for
	Sheila while he's, uh, loose.

<b>44     EXT. WOODS - NIGHTMARE				     44

The heels of Junior's running feet.

<b>		KASTLE (OS)
</b>	Junior's a problem child. He has a thing
	about -

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>		(wails)
<b>	SHEILA!
</b>
<b>45     INT. MILES KASTLE'S OFFICE				 45
</b>
Theo snaps out of it, the room lights come up, and Kastle
points to her image on the TV screen. Sheila turns and looks
up at the video camera. Theo and Sheila's eyes seem to meet.
Theo freezes for a moment.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I could do that.

As the two men shake hands, Sheila "flips the bird" to the
camera.

<b>		KASTLE

Theo and Sheila blast along the dark roadway on her Vespa,
Theo sitting behind Sheila.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(shouting above the engine)
	This is a vicious cycle.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	I think that a motorbike is one of the
	last really free things that people can
	do.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Isn't this technically a scooter?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild
	person.
		(she looks sideways at Theo)
	Better than any sex I've ever had.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Kinda tough on the butt.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Everything has it's drawbacks.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Where did your brother escape from?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	The mental hospital.

<b>		THEO
</b>	What does he do?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	He follows me, he tries to have sex with
	me, and then they send him to the nut-hut
	for a while and then he gets out and then
	he follows me, he tries to have sex with

</b>	It's a vicious cycle.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>47     EXT. PARKING FIELD				   47
</b>
Sheila and Theo motor across an empty beach parking field
towards a lone station wagon. Swing-a-delic MUSIC drifts from
the parked vehicle.

<b>47     EXT. STATION WAGON				   47
</b>
Sheila pulls up beside the wagon. She leads Theo towards a
group of partying people at the tailgate of the car; three
white women, three white men and Luna. Luna pulls a rubber
hookah hose out of his mouth and offers it to Theo.

<b>		LUNA
</b>	Hookah?

<b>		THEO
</b>	No thanks, I don't hookah.

<b>		LUNA
</b>	Theo, you ever do the 'Swing'?

Theo shakes his head.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	These guys all work at the alley, too.
	This is John, Susan, Jon, Suzanne,
	Jonathan, and Sue. Everyone welcomes Theo
	and Sheila.

<b>		LUNA
</b>		(screams)
	Dance Break!

Luna throws himself into a wild body-whip as the music THROBS
massively.

<b>EXT. DANCE
</b>
Luna and Sheila do a wild jitterbug-derived Swing-a-Delic
dance surrounded by weaving white folk.

<b>EXT. BARBECUE
</b>
One of the guys is on crutches, has a neck brace, a chest
cast, and one arm in a truss. He stands by the barbecue and
flips burgers with his one free hand. Theo walks over to him.

<b>		GUY
</b>	Hey man, howyadoin'?

He wiggles his hand out of the end of his cast. Theo shakes
his fingers.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Don't tell me, John.

<b>		JOHN
</b>	Cool!

<b>		THEO
</b>	Theo. Howzitgoin.

<b>		JOHN
</b>	Hey man, welcome to our parking lot.
	Lemme give you some advice, if she asks
	you to dance, make sure her brother's not
	around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot
	light, if you get my meaning.

<b>		THEO
</b>	How's that?

<b>		JOHN
</b>	I was doing the lambada with her and the
	guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to
	kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I
	was a pi�ata. If nobody else hadn't a
	been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He
	woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just
	snapped. How do you like your burger?

<b>		THEO
</b>		(meets eyes with Sheila)
	Uh...over easy.

<b>		JOHN
</b>		(throws a blackened burger on
		 Theo's styrofoam plate)
	I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me
	around that alley with that freak on the
	loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't
	play any of his fuckin' knock-knock
	jokes.

Luna comes over to Theo and grabs him. They start to dance.

<b>		LUNA
</b>	Sheila wants me to show you a few steps
	before you two swing-a-delic.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(uneasily)
	So, you're the pinman around here?

<b>		LUNA
</b>	...And one, and two, and yes, I am. But
	no one gets them working like Junior used
	to...and two, and one.. - they call him
	The 'Quasimodo of the lanes.' He's the
	best pinman there is.. and one and
	two...People used to say he got the
	machines working so well 'cause he
	lubricated them with blood...and two, and
	one...but people just love saying things
	about Junior.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Mind if I cut in?

<b>		THEO
</b>	No, not at all.

<b>EXT. DANCE
</b>
Theo pulls out his resin bag, powders up his hands, and goes
for Sheila. Theo and Sheila get low and nasty on the tarmac.
Sheila turns and does the freak to Theo, rubbing her rear end
into his crotch. As Theo and Sheila dance over near John he
makes a throat slitting gesture across his neck. Theo's hands
leave white prints on Sheila's butt. The Swing-a-delic funks
so hard it causes spontaneous audience dance riots and
structural damage in theaters across the country.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	You and your sideburns are the talk of
	the party, Theo.

<b>		THEO
</b>	The ladies in Akron call them thigh-
	ticklers.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Can I ask you something personal?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'd rather you didn't.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Do you have a girlfriend?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Not while I'm in training.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Do you have a boyfriend?

<b>		THEO
</b>		(surprised)
	No. Do You?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	No. Not at the present.

<b>EXT. PARKING FIELD - NIGHT
</b>
Sheila and Theo toast marshmallows over the barbecue as the
rest of the party dances in the background.

<b>		THEO
</b>	So this brother of yours is hazardous to
	the health of your dates?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Nobody in this town really understands
	Junior. When I went to family sessions
	for him I realized he was the sanest one
	in the family. Actually, he's the only
	one in this whole fucking town who knows
	exactly who he is and what he wants.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Unfortunately what he wants is you.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	So, what about you?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Do I want you?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	We'll get into that later.

Alone, Kastle stares at the bank of video monitors and runs a
battery powered fuzzball remover around his collar. The
monitors are deserted. Miles absently pans a camera over and
then sits bolt upright. On the screen he can see Buzz Fazeli,
in a room at Babylon Lanes, surrounded by large piles of
cash, stuffing rolls of bills into hollow bowling pins.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(with rising anger)
	Why that filthy, slimey, double-crossing,
	misbegotten, two-faced, mangy, son-of-a-
	bitch bastard!

The motor in the fuzz ball remover SHRIEKS as Miles squeezes
it to death. It shatters in his hands.

<b>49     EXT. PARKING FIELD - NIGHT				 49
</b>
Theo and Sheila lie on the roof of the station wagon. "Devil
With The Blue Dress" by Shorty Long plays on the stereo. The
rest of the party throws marshmallows at each other in the
distance.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Theo, what would you do if you couldn't
	bowl?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to
	do.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	I wanted to be a motocross champion. My
	folks didn't really care what I did. Then
	Junior blew a fuse and I became their
	last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed
	down their throats, I got bowling. I
	never understood how anyone could take it
	so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting
	you.

<b>		THEO
</b>	No, I'm fascinated.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Why were you suspended?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I used to be kind of wild. They used to
	call me the bad boy of bowling.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	So you're hoping Buzz can get you re-
	instated?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Well, that was plan A.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	What's plan B?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Plan B is your dad.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	What do you think my dad's gonna do for
	you?

<b>		THEO
</b>	He said he'd sponsor me.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Ha! And what do you have to do for him?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Nothing.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do
	anything unless there's something in it
	for him.

<b>		THEO
</b>	He asked me to keep an eye on you for a
	couple of days.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	What? Be my body guard?
		(she laughs)
	Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my
	dad's sake. For your career. Sheila
	starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Sheila, please.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Come on Theo, what about plan C?

<b>		THEO
</b>		(looking worried)
	What's plan C?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Plan C...
		(opens her shirt, showing off
		 her brassiere)
	...is me.

Sheila takes Theo's nervous hands and places them inside her
shirt.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(torn)
	Look, Sheila, I really like you but...
	Sheila rolls on top of him, and plants a
	hickey on his neck.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(stopping her)
	Forget it, Sheila.

<b>50     INT. MILES 'O' LANES				 50

Kastle hurries through the darkened bowling alley. He stops
short as a warning alarm begins to sound from somewhere deep
within the building. Lane six lights up and comes to life.
Kastle walks slowly forward.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Junior? Is that you, Junior? Don't be
	afraid. Where are you? I won't hurt you.

<b>INT. MACHINERY GALLEY
</b>
Kastle stealthily sneaks along beside row upon row of silent
pin reset machines shining a flashlight in front of him.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for
	you, son. The beam of light catches
	Junior's face. He is crouched inside the
	machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut
	and bleeding and his straitjacket torn
	and filthy.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	Needs lubrication. Lubrication.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	We're having a party for you, boy. Cake
	and shish-k-bob, just like you love.
	Junior cringes away from the light.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	You made me hurt him!

Kastle reaches into his pocket and pulls a gaudy digital
wristwatch from his pocket.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Look what I got for you.

He holds the watch up in front of Junior. Junior looks
curiously at the watch.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Happy Birthday Junior!

The watch begins to play an electronic version of "Raindrops
Keep Falling On My Head." Junior's face lights up.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	Ooooooohhh.

Kastle begins luring Junior out of machine number six with
the watch.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	I have someone for you to play with
	Junior.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	Someone wants to play with me?

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	I have someone for you to play Blueface

</b>
Breeze drives. Sid gazes out the window. Enrico Caruso WAILS
from the car stereo.

<b>		SID
</b>	Bowling used to be so pure, so...All-

	and pretends to conduct.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	La da da dalala...

<b>		SID
</b>		(looking heatedly disturbed)
	I hate fuckin' opera.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has
	all the drama and excitement of real life
	- to music!

<b>		SID
</b>	How do you know, you don't even speak
	Latin?

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	You listen to the feelings, not the

Sid seems to calm down.

<b>		SID
</b>		(wistfully)
	You know, Elvis bowled.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	No kiddin'.

</b>	Bowling was the most incorruptible sport.
	No megalomillionaires, no

	could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>		(sympathetically)
	Sure, Sid.

<b>		SID
</b>		(becoming rabid)
	But not no more. Now people take
	advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to
	be. There's something evil spreading in
	this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss-
	ridden -

<b>		BREEZE
</b>		(getting excited)
	- canker sore.

<b>		SID
</b>		(apoplectic)
	Right, eating at the core, eating it's

Sid starts pressing buttons on the tape deck

<b>		SID
</b>	How do you turn this thing off?

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Wait! That's an aria!

Sid and Breeze struggle for the cassette. The music DISTORTS
into a warbling gurgle of an aria.

<b>		SID
</b>	Gimme that!

Sid yanks the cassette out, but the tape becomes tangled in
the player. He pulls at the endless yards of tape and throws
the whole mess out the window.

<b>52     EXT. PETER PAN DINER - DAY				 52

Theo, wearing sunglasses and dressed in a jogging suit
similar to Miles Kastle's, steps out of the diner with a bag
containing four orange whips. He goes over to his parked car.
Buzz walks up.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(in deadly serious)
	Theo, I want you to get out of this town.

	He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest
	of your life.

</b>	You got a better offer?

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	No...

<b>		THEO
</b>	I didn't think so.

Theo takes a long drag from his orange whip.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Not for somebody who hit a man with his
	ball on national television.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(bitterly)
	That's right, Buzz, and you know when I
	did it? Last match, last frame. All I
	needed was one spare for the crown - and
	I get stuck with the seven-ten, the
	Fazeli Split.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	You never even took the shot. You
	couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz
	in a threatening manner.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(repressed fury in his voice)
	I was beaten on a shot named after my own
	dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and
	climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.
		(taps chest)
	I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm
	finished - dead from my ankles up.

Theo starts his car.

</b>	You know what I think? You didn't

come here to find a father. You didn't even come here for
help. You just came here to take it all out on somebody. Well

Sheila has the headset of her Vespa disassembled. Theo walks
up the driveway, orange whips in hand.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	I don't think your new outfit suits you,
	Theo.

	Really? I kinda like it.

He sits nearby.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Do you talk with your mom?

<b>		THEO
</b>	It's been awhile. She didn't want me

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	My mom told me not to stay in this town.

<b>		THEO
</b>	So why do you stay?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a
	binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm
	trapped in his easy payment plan.

<b>		THEO

</b>	I could let them go for ten.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>		(she pulls away, slightly)
	You professional men drive a hard
	bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on
	me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(smiles)
	If you want a professional man, you have
	to be willing to pay for him.

<b>54     EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, DECK				    54
</b>
Sheila and Theo stand on the deck. Sheila scans the road
leading to the house with binoculars.

<b>		THEO
</b>	What are you going to do about your
	brother?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	You're here.

<b>		THEO
</b>	What about the guy he put in the body
	cast?

<b>		BINOCULAR POV
</b>	The road is empty

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Momentary relapse. Except for that, he's
	been making progress. Sheila laughs. Theo
	nervously pulls his collar up over the
	hickey on his neck.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Junior is like a faithful doggy. He loves
	his birthday so much, that every year,
	before we can go pick him up...

<b>		BINOCULAR POV
</b>	Kastle's car appears, driving hell-for-
	leather towards the house.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	...he breaks out of the hospital and
	comes home on his own. Here they come.
	She hands the binoculars to Theo, who
	immediately trains them on the road.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	My mom once had an affair. When my dad
	found out, he had Junior kill the man.
	The body was never found, but I think
	Junior took him to the alley. Theo lowers
	the binoculars and looks at Sheila.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Then it's true, isn't it? About...

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	...lane six. Yes.

<b>55     EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, DRIVEWAY				55
</b>
Kastle's car comes belly-flopping to a stop in front of the
house. Kastle climbs out and gesticulates wildly to the
couple.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(a loud whisper)
	He's here! Come on down!

<b>BLACKNESS INSIDE THE TRUNK
</b>
<b>		KASTLE (OS)
</b>		(muffled)
	OK, hats on everybody.

SOUNDS of the group gathering outside can be heard.

<b>		SHEILA (OS)
</b>		(muffled)
	Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.

<b>		KASTLE (OS)
</b>		(muffled)
	Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three.
	One...two...three!

The lid flies up and Kastle, Sheila, and Theo stand there,
with party hats and party horns in their mouths. They all
cheer and throw confetti.

<b>		EVERYONE
</b>	Surprise!

Kastle takes a flash snapshot. Junior, lying on some folded
blankets in the trunk, looks at his family with a stunned
expression. He is in a straitjacket. Junior's new watch
begins to PLAY "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head". He
struggles to pull his arm out, but can't. Kastle reaches in
to untie the straitjacket.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Steady boy, steady.

Untied, Junior presses the BEEPING watch against his ear. His
face breaks into a beatific smile.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>56     EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, PICNIC TABLE - AFTERNOON		    56
</b>
Kastle pulls shish kebab chunks off a skewer. He looks down
to see that one of the chunks is a melted Ken head. He throws
it away in disgust.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	I bet you didn't know that you and Junior
	have something in common, Theo: Junior
	can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that
	right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup
	bottle down on Junior's right hand. The
	table settings jump from the shock.
	Junior sits impassively, his face a
	blank.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened
	to your hand, Junior.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	After we eat, Dad.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	He stuck it in the ball return machine
	when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve
	endings. Junior starts stroking the
	ketchup bottle with his dead hand.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels
	like someone else. Sheila grabs the
	bottle from Junior, opens it and pours
	some on her shish kebab. She leans over
	and whispers furiously to her father.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Do you have to get your hooks into every
	guy I'm interested in?

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(whispers back, defensively)
	You're just like you mother! Always
	jealous!

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	That's why Mom ran away, because you had
	to control everything!

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	She ran away to be with that...
		(spits out his words)
	that Motocross champion.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	Your turn, Theo. Why can't you bowl?

Sheila and Kastle sit up.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I don't like to talk about it.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't
	you?

<b>		THEO
</b>	It depends.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	It feels good to let it out, doesn't it?
	Sheila leans over and whispers furiously
	to her father.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	You're using Theo for your own deviant
	purposes!

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Look who's talking!

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Leave him alone!

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Just because your mother signed part
	ownership of the lanes over to you,
	doesn't mean you have a right to tell me
	how to run my business! I can have my
	lawyers take that deed away from you like
	that.
		(snaps his fingers)
	Sheila and Kastle sit up.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Junior, how 'bout a riddle?

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>		(turns to Sheila)
	Sheila. Knock-knock.

Sheila glances nervously at Theo.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>		(impatiently)
	Come on Sheila, knock-knock.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Who's there?

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	Junior.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Junior who?

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	J'you-and-your-friend do it yet?
		(laughs)

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(laughing)
	Fantastic! What talent.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>		(caustically)
	You still got the touch Junior.

<b>57     EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, CAKE				    57
</b>
A bowling pin-shaped cake with candles ablaze is presented to
a seated Junior. He is wearing a paper birthday hat. The four
orange whips are arrayed around the table.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Make a wish, son.

Junior stares into Sheila's eyes for several seconds.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	Same wish as last year.

Sheila blows out the candles in a hurry.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	It won't come true, Junior.

Kastle places a gift-wrapped box in front of Junior and lifts
the lid. He reaches in and pulls out a huge, intricate claw-
like arm-shaped device made of plastic and metal and covered
with cables.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	It's a bowling claw. You can bowl now,
	Junior. With the whole family. Junior
	beams at the group.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(puts one arm around Junior and
		 one on Theo)
	Pretty soon everybody can bowl!

The two sleazeballs walk up onto the deck and over to the
table.

<b>		SID
</b>	Hello Mr. Kastle.
		(nods to seated party)
	Junior, long time. I thought they locked
	you up and threw away the warden!

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Is it true they blacked out the whole
	county giving you electro-shock? Junior
	looks from one man to the other,
	breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	Knock, knock.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Who's...

<b>		SID
</b>		(interrupting)
	Don't do it Breeze!
		(to Junior)
	You ain't getting us into that.

Kastle gets up.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Hey, enough fun and games. We have work
	to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for
	his car. Junior gets up and follows. The
	two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.

<b>		SID
</b>		(to Theo)
	If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy-
	bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap
	dance on your spleen.
		(pokes Theo in the side)

<b>		BREEZE
</b>		(pulls down Theo's collar to
		 reveal the hickey)
	With cleats.

The two men turn, laughing, and follow Kastle.

<b>58     EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, DRIVEWAY				58
</b>
Kastle huddles with Sid and Breeze, Jr. stands nearby
fiddling with his new bowling arm.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Buzz has been moving the cash out in
	hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw
	sideways glances at each other.

<b>		SID
</b>	No!

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring
	him to lane six. Junior will take it from
	there.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>		(perks up at mention of lane
		 six)
	I'm gonna play Blue Face!

Buzz checks if the coast is clear and then stuffs boxes of

</b>
<b>60     EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, DECK				    60
</b>
Theo and Kastle stand on the deck watching the sleazeballs
put Junior into the trunk of their car. Kastle lights an
oversized cigar and hands one to Theo.

<b>		MILES
</b>	Champ, as soon as you get back on the
	tour, we should do an instructional
	videotape. 'RAMBOWL' Theo Skinner teaches
	Power Bowling. You on the cover with a
	flame thrower. Kastle lights Theo's cigar
	and they puff away.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Theo, how would you like to be my new
	partner?

<b>		THEO
</b>	You already have a partner Mr. Kastle.
	Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car
	pulls out of the driveway.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I
	think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls
	out a shiny gold credit card and holds it
	in front of Sheila.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Here, Bunny. Why don't you two go and do
	something fun tonight, on me. Sheila is
	lured to the scent of the plastic like a
	junkie to a fix.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	One thing, stay away from the lanes. If
	Junior sees you two together, he'll
	swallow his tongue.
	She reaches for the card and Kastle
	snatches it away from her with a chortle.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	What did I say?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Don't go near the bowling alley.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(enunciating clearly)
	Bowling "Center"!

Kastle hands her the card and heads into the house.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in
	danger, would it?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Nope, I couldn't care less.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed
	your help, right?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Why should I help that old fuck.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>		(sarcastically)
	Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for
	you?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Zip.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	And besides, it's probably too late,
	anyhow.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(exhaling cigar smoke)
	Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.
		(goes to take another drag,
		 then stops)
	Too late for what?

She turns away.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Nothing.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Too late for what, Sheila?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	You know how people with broken bones
	know when there's a storm coming?

<b>		THEO
</b>	You got any broken bones?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	No, but something's gonna blow in this
	town. I can feel it.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is
	something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila
	seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is
	unable.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>		(faltering)
	I can't tell you, Theo.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Why not?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	I saw your eyes when you hit that guy
	with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles.
	Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(gently)
	Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of?
	Sheila shakes her head.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	I'm afraid you'll hurt him.

<b>		THEO
</b>	It's Junior, isn't it.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>		(starting to cry)
	I can't - I can't do it.
		(she looks up through her tears
		 at Theo)
	He's my brother.

Sid and Breeze's car sits in front of Buzz's house. 8-track
opera PLAYS on the car stereo. A man screams and glass
smashes.

<b>INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE
</b>
P.O.V. shot running desperately through the house, knocking
things over, smashing things. We HEAR Buzz screaming in
terror. The scream is cut off. With a THUD, the camera falls
over and hits the floor. The golf ball rolls slowly into
view, and stops. Footsteps recede, a door slams, and a car
drives away.

<b>62     EXT. MILES 'O' LANES - NIGHT			   62

Theo and Sheila walk her Vespa up to the darkened alley. Theo
is wearing his own clothes again. The SOUND of a lone bowler
is heard. Theo straps on his wristbrace. Sheila pulls out
keys.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	These open the back door. Don't let him
	catch you behind the machines; if he
	does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at
	the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila
	grabs his arm.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	You don't have to do this. We could just
	cut out of here, go to Akron,  or
	anywhere else.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(dislodging her hand gently)
	I'll be at the bridge.

<b>63     INT. MILES 'O' LANES				 63
</b>
Theo snakes his way along the rows of pin machines, towards
the only light source - lane six. As he leans in to peer
through the machine, a ball EXPLODES into the pins. Junior,
wearing his elaborate bowling claw, is working himself into a
sweaty froth. Junior picks up his ball and sends it CRASHING
into the pins.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Knock-knock.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>		(stops and looks around)
	Who's there?

Theo remains silent.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>		(getting angry)
	Who's there!

<b>		THEO
</b>	Buzz Fazeli.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's
	there. I say who's there and then you say
	who who. You're not playing right.
		(primly)
	Knock-knock.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Who's there?

Junior walks towards Theo.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	Junior.

Theo remains silent.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b><b>	JUNIOR!
</b>		(boiling)
	You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm
	going to have to hurt you. Theo and
	Junior circle one another.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	You shouldn't touch her.

<b>		THEO
</b>	No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch
	her. Sheila told me you played bouncy-
	bouncy with her.

<b>		THEO
</b>	What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz?
	Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and
	knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his
	ankles.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I
	like games.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(struggling to get away)
	What did you do to Buzz?

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so
	I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.
		(he grabs Theo's throat)

<b>		THEO
</b>		(hoarsely)
	I don't want to play.

Theo stretches to get a nearby ball, but just can't reach it,
by millimeters.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	To play, I press my fingers on a throat
	like this...
		(he presses tighter on Theo's
		 windpipe)
	...and then the mans face would go blue
	and I should keep pressing...
		(Theo's face goes pale blue)
	...and I did and then he stopped moving
	and he didn't play anymore after that.
	Theo bends back a finger on Junior's
	hand. Junior lets out a HOWL of pain and
	releases Theo's neck. Theo GASPS for air.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	You didn't play fair.
		(stands up)
	You were almost blue.

Theo gets his fingers in a bowling ball and brings it up to
bash Junior in the head.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	Go ahead Theo, I saw you on TV. I'm your
	biggest fan. Junior offers Theo his
	unprotected head.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>		(yelling)
	Come on Theo, GIVE ME YOUR AUTOGRAPH!

Theo bashes Junior in the head with the ball. It bounces off
Junior's head like a Nerf ball and rolls down the alley.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	Thank you, Mr. Skinner! Thank you!

Theo desperately, but fruitlessly tries to get away. As he
crawls over the ball return trough, Junior puts his foot on
Theo's head.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	I can have her,you know.
		(looks around and whispers)
	She's not my real sister.
		(he flashes a lecherous smile)
		 THEO'S POV A ball pops up at
		 the far end of the return and
		 TRUNDLES rapidly towards Theo.
		 The ball hits Theo's face with
		 a POW. BLACK OUT We HEAR
		 "Raindrops Keep Falling On My
		 Head." THEO'S BOWLING SHOE
		 ATTIRED FEET Being dragged
		 down the lane. Theo comes to
		 and looks down his body to see
		 the empty lane. He looks up to

		 the pin reset machine. The cut
		 on Theo's forehead bleeds down
		 the side of his face.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>		(muttering)
	Lubrication.

<b>MACHINE NUMBER 6
</b>
Junior pulls the dazed Theo into the pin-reset machine and
positions him under the pins. As Junior prepares the
machinery, a control cable on his claw becomes fouled. Junior
begins to thrash about as he tries to disentangle himself and
his malfunctioning arm. Theo rolls away as Junior's flailing
releases the machine. It comes slamming down on Junior just
as Theo slips out of harm's way. He gets up and staggers away
from the machine. Junior's HOWL echoes across the lanes. His
twitching feet protrude from the maw of the device. Lane six
goes dark. Theo limps up the lane.

<b>						CUT TO:

<b>64     EXT. BRIDGE					64

Theo drives up to the erect draw-bridge. He stops and gets
out. The night is silent.

<b>		THEO

	Sheila! Where are you?

Sheila pops out of the bushes and walks towards Theo.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(angry)
	You told Junior that we did it.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	It?

<b>		THEO
</b>	It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to
	squeeze my fucking head off. What did you
	say to him?
	When they reach each other, they stop.
	Sheila seems to weigh her answer.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	I told him you were my boyfriend.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(very pissed off)
	What the hell did you go doing that for
	Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	We would have sooner or later.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew
	he would go off if he thought I fooled
	around with you.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Did you - kill him?

Theo paces up and down in front of the upright bridge.

<b>		THEO
</b>	How do you get this thing down?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Tell me what happened Theo.

Theo backs Sheila towards the bridge control booth.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(glares at Sheila)
	You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>		(in shock)
	If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.

<b>		THEO
</b>	He's dead Sheila.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	I feel sick.

<b>		THEO
</b>	You should.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Are you sure he's dead?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I didn't stop to take his pulse.

Theo boosts Sheila up the ladder to the control booth. The
hydraulic machinery of the bridge heaves into motion and the
bridge begins to lower. Theo walks over to his car. Sheila
jumps down from the bridge control booth and follows him.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Where are you going?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I think your brother may have already
	gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Can I come with you?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now
	fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila
	standing alone. She watches his car
	recede with a thoughtful expression, then
	turns on her heel.

Theo grips the steering wheel with white knuckles. He nods
off at the wheel, the roadway through his eyes wavering and
distorting. He hits himself in the face in an effort to keep
himself awake.

<b>66     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE - NIGHTMARE			  66

The house is dark except for a light coming from the closed
bathroom door. Theo cautiously makes his way to the door.

<b>		THEO

	Buzz? You alright?

WATER is running inside. Theo twists the doorknob and opens
the door with a jolt. Junior lunges out of the dark, mangled
and bloody with bowling pins sticking out of his chest.

<b>		JUNIOR
</b>	Don't you KNOCK?

Theo SLAMS the door shut.

<b>67     EXT. BUZZ'S HOUSE - DAWN				   67
</b>
Theo jerks awake. His car is parked by the Fazeli house. It
is a clear, blustery day.
A gust of wind pulls the screen door open, then SLAMS it
shut. He gets out of the car and walks unsteadily towards the
house.

<b>68     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM			 68
</b>
Theo walks into the house. The place is completely trashed.
Theo picks up a golf ball from the floor. He makes his way to
the bathroom door and slowly turns the knob; then pulls back.
He picks up a nearby bowling ball and holds it over his head
as he reaches for the doorknob. This time, he thrusts the
door open. The bathroom is empty. Relieved, he cradles the
ball in his arms.

<b>		BALL
</b>	Thick crimson red fluid trickles down his
	forearm, dripping off his elbow.
	Horrified, he pulls his fingers out of
	the ball. Blood streams out of the three
	finger holes. He drops the ball to the
	floor. He goes into the bathroom and
	turns on the sink faucets.

<b>INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, BATHROOM
</b>
Water runs as Theo manically washes the blood from his hands
and arms. He rinses the blood from the holes of his ball and
looks up to the mirror. "NOK NOK" is smeared in blood across
his reflection.

<b>69     EXT. 7-ELEVEN PHONE BOOTH - DAY			69

</b>	Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I found dad.

<b>		GRACE
</b>	He's dead, isn't he.
		(pauses)
	Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died
	before you were born.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did
	it a little too late.

<b>		GRACE
</b>	You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not
	bowling are you?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I gotta go. Love ya mom.

Theo hangs up the phone. Alfie shuffles over.

<b>		ALFIE
</b>	Did you hear about that bowler who got
	smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out
	of the alley. I heard he was kacked but
	good. They had to take apart the pin
	machine to get him out.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(stunned)
	The pin machine?

<b>		ALFIE
</b>	Just like Junior did the last time; lane
	six. All's I know is it's gonna be a
	closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay
	low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven
	shades, flips up his collar and skulks
	away.

<b>70     EXT. MILES 'O' LANES				 70
</b>
Theo pulls into the parking lot. The place is cordoned off
with day-glo yellow emergency tape printed with "Bowling
Police - Do Not Cross". A black bowling police van, its blue
light spinning, is parked in front. Bowling cops herd dwarfs
and customers into the van. Mothers and daughters mill around
behind the yellow tape. A group of little people brandish
"Right to Work" signs. Theo gets out of his car. The crowd
moves in as Kastle, hands cuffed behind him, emerges from the
door.

<b>		LITTLE GIRL
</b>	There he is!

Camera flashes POP all over the place. Two black-jacketed
bowling cops step out behind him. They are Sid and Breeze.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Bowling police, step back, give him room.

<b>		SID
</b>	Nothing going on here, everybody stand
	back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies,
	please. As they start to move through the
	female throng, a little girl pops out in
	front of them, holding her ball.

<b>		LITTLE GIRL
</b>	Mr. Kastle, we know you wouldn't do
	anything bad.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	Thank-you, sweetheart.
		(turns to Breeze)
	See that you pinheads! Character witness.
		(with sweeping head gesture)
	They're all character witnesses!
		(he sees Theo)
	Thanks to Buzz Fazeli, bowling is dead in
	this town! He KILLED it! The two officers
	hustle Kastle towards the van. Theo steps
	out in front of him.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(between clenched teeth)
	You fool, we could have done great things
	together!

<b>		THEO
</b>	Where's Junior?

<b>		KASTLE
</b>	He killed your stoolie embezzler father,
	and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and
	Breeze push him towards the van as the
	crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns
	and yells over his shoulder.

<b>		KASTLE
</b>		(shouting)
	Lock your daughters up, ladies! Junior's
	out there! Mothers and daughters send out
	a cacophony of screams and scatter for
	their cars. The BP cops hoist Kastle into
	the back of the van. Sid slams the doors
	shut. The van screeches off, sirens
	wailing. Sid and Breeze walk up to Theo.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Sorry about your loss.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(shaking his head)
	I should've pegged you guys for bowling
	dicks from day one.

<b>		SID
</b>	You should probably hit the road. Go
	home. This place could get hazardous for
	your health.

<b>		THEO
</b>	So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.

<b>		SID
</b>	You call it stooling, we call it
	cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's
	car.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Did you know you were parked in the
	handicap space?

<b>		SID
</b>	Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.

Theo gets into his car and starts the engine. Sid and Breeze
poke their heads in the windows.

<b>		SID
</b>	She told us you went after Junior to save
	your old man's hide. You got some balls
	goin' after that psycho.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Only problem is, you didn't put his
	lights out, you just got him mad. Then he
	took it out on poor Faz, God rest his
	soul. Theo patches out.

<b>		SID
</b>	Think he bought it?

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	I'd buy it!

Sid chews his lip worriedly.

<b>71     INT. THEO'S CAR - AFTERNOON				71
</b>
Theo nods off for a second and then snaps back. His eyes seem
hypnotized by the lines on the road which seem to swim and
undulate unnaturally. He nods again. And snaps again.

<b>72     EXT. PARKING FIELD - TWILIGHT			  72
</b>
Theo pulls up to the old party spot and gets out. He walks
over the dunes and towards the beached station wagon. A huge
flame rises down the beach. A woman is visible in its light,
tossing objects into the fire. Theo walks towards her.

<b>EXT. BEACH, BONFIRE
</b>
Sheila is stripping Barbie and Ken dolls and tossing them
onto the pyre. Each one goes up in an exaggerated  WHOOSH of
flames. She notices Theo when he steps into the light.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Once my father walked in on me while I
	was making Barbie and Ken do it. He
	freaked. I was seven. He took all my
	dolls away from me and cut them in half.
	He gave the top halves back to
		(more)

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	me. Then he made me watch him burn the
	bottom halves in the fireplace. Theo
	kneels down nearby and throws a Barbie
	onto the bonfire. It goes up with a
<b>	WHOOSH.
</b>
<b>		SHEILA
</b>	I can see Junior's face in the fire.

Theo puts his hand on Sheila's hand. She looks at him.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Why did you come back?

<b>		THEO
</b>	When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even
	think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in
	his arms and kisses her passionately. She
	stops him and looks around nervously.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I killed him once, I'll just have to kill
	him again.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	You don't get two chances with Junior.

<b>		THEO
</b>	At least I'll die smiling.

Sheila pushes him over. He falls backwards, her on top.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	And you only get two chances with me.

Sheila yanks her shirt over her head and tosses it away.

<b>		FIRE
</b>	The shirt CRACKLES and burns.

She pulls Theo's head up to her breasts.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	What's it gonna be, Theo?

A Barbie's breasts blister from the heat.

<b>		THEO & SHEILA
</b>	Theo bends Sheila backwards, down on her
	back. She grabs the tail of his shirt,
	yanks it over his head and off his body.
	Sheila rubs her hands up Theo's back.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	What's the plan, Theo?

A Ken back bubbles and melts. Theo lifts Sheila's back off
the sand and works her jeans down her legs.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Say something, Theo. Give me something. A
	doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into
	Sheila's eyes.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C.
	Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy
	hands sliding over each others' sweaty
	skin.

<b>		THEO
</b>	It's gonna be you, Sheila.

They humpty-hump to the beat of "Scientist's"
'DEMATERIALIZE.' We hear Theo and Sheila's stereophonic
MOANING as a Barbie and a Ken doll collapse and vaporize from
the blazing heat.
We pan up through the flames, the MOANS increasing in volume
and intensity as they reach the you-know-what-we've-all-been-
waiting-for.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>73     EXT. CEMETERY - DAY				  73
</b>
A coffin moves slowly forward as a solemn DIRGE plays. The
top is in the shape of a bowling alley with a miniature black
bowling ball inscribed with "The Faz" at the head. The
pallbearers; Theo, Breeze, Sid, Tina, and two other bowlers
place the coffin on poles above the grave. A rotund priest
sprinkles holy water. Sheila stands next to Theo, crying.
(more)

Theo wears a glazed look. The priest clears his throat with a
loud AHEM.

<b>		PRIEST
</b>		(with pomp and vigor)
	Bowling!
		(pauses to reflect)
	Bowling is a little like faith. Every now
	and then, we are blessed with the ability
	and strength to send a full roller down..
		(makes bowling gesture)
	...and scatter those babies like nobody's
	business. And every now and then we end
	up in the gutter.
		(pauses and gets glum)
	Buzz Fazeli found himself in the gutter
	of life. Trapped in hook alley, throwing
	nothing balls. But before he left us for
	that pie alley in the clouds, he pulled
	himself out of that gutter.
	Buzz Fazeli died cleaning up the sport of
	bowling. Now he lies at peace alongside
	his lane brothers here in Bowlers' Field.
		(makes sign of the cross)
	He died so that we could bowl - with
	dignity. Millie, decked out in mourning
	black, lets out a wail, steps up and
	throws a bouquet of flowers onto the
	coffin.

<b>		MILLIE
</b>		(sniffles)
	I forgive you Buzz.

Sid leans over to Theo.

<b>		SID
</b>		(in loud whisper)
	The Faz sure took care a her.
		(points to Millie, does the
		 cash rub with fingers)
	Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to
	suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep
	a straight face - elbows him. Sid and
	Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls
	an orange whip out of a paper bag and
	carefully places it on the coffin lid.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.

<b>		SID
</b>	See ya 'round Faz.

Tina steps up to the grave with a handful of papers.

<b>		TINA
</b>	These are all your perfect games.
		(she drops scoresheets onto the
		 coffin)
	Bowl with God, Buzz.

Mourners sniff and cry. The coffin starts descending into the
ground. A stiff breeze scatters the scoresheets. Sheila
nudges Theo who approaches and tosses a handful of soil into
the grave.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Maybe you were right Buzz. Maybe I did
	just come here to take it out on
	somebody. But, I had to find my father...
	The muffled BEEPING of "Raindrops Keep
	Falling On My Head" begins playing from
	inside the coffin. Theo's body jolts. He
	runs after Sheila who is walking towards
	her scooter.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Buzz is alive, Sheila.

The two sleazeballs gaze surreptitiously at him as they walk
towards their car. Theo grabs Sheila's jacket.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Theo, Buzz is dead.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I didn't come this far to bury a guy
	that's not my dad. He owes me.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>		(bitterly)
	Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all
	over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my
	whole life. She walks over to her
	scooter, and mounts it.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm
	the one who's free. If I gotta do this
	alone, I might as well start now. She
	revs up and peals out.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(yells)
<b>	SSHHEEIILLAAA!
</b>
<b>74     EXT. CEMETERY PARKING LOT				  74
</b>
As Sid and Breeze walk up to their car, Theo catches up with
them.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Why is Junior's watch in that coffin?
	Something stinks around here.

<b>		SID
</b>	Your time is up, busyboy.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Who identified the body?

<b>		SID
</b>	The body was identified along proper
	Bowling Congress guidelines for
	processing a bowling related fatality.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'm the next of kin. I should've seen
	him.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	After we ID, we bury the body. Case and
	casket closed.

<b>		THEO
</b>	You tried to make it look like Junior
	trashed his place. Junior's underground
	in that coffin you dicks put him in.

<b>		BREEZE
</b>	It's splitsville for you.

Sid and Breeze back away from Theo.

<b>		THEO
</b>	You faked my dad's murder. You used him!
	Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze
	around their car. He catches Sid and
	grabs the middle fingers on his right
	hand. Sid howls.

<b>		SID
</b>	Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back
	on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze!
	Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler"
	from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB
<b>	OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM
</b>	KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.

<b>		SID
</b>	It's official, you're an orphan.

Happy now, busyboy? Theo stares at the newspaper. He lets
Sid's fingers drop.

<b>75     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY				   75
</b>
Sheila speeds along, her Vespa maxing out at 30 mph. From
behind her we see Theo's car approaching rapidly. He pulls up
beside her.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(shouting and pointing
		 	frantically)
	What makes you think you know me so well
	that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Who said anything about an ultimatum? You
	want to find your father? Get a shovel
	and start digging. Hurry up, he's
	probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila
	makes a pathetic attempt to speed away
	from Theo. He moves up beside her again.

<b>		THEO
</b>	You're really pissing me off.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I
	said I'd do. What the hell are you doing?
	What about your word?

<b>		THEO
</b>	My word is good, and it'll always be
	good. When did I ever give my word to
	you?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	What about plan C?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Fuck plan C!

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Your word is so good, you're never gonna
	give it to anyone.

<b>		THEO
</b>	You think I'm dumping you to get back
	into bowling. Well who's dumping who?

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Sez you!

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Suck my dick!

She speeds ahead.

<b>76     EXT. HIGHWAY				         76
</b>
Theo THUNDERS along in his car. He listens to his SONG over
the stereo. Theo digs into his pocket and pulls out the golf
ball from Buzz's house.

<b>77     GOLF BALL					  77
</b>
The logo on the ball reads "PARADISE."

<b>		THEO
</b>	Paradise.

The white ball fills the frame.

<b>		THEO (OS)
</b>		(whispers to himself)
	Paradise. Hmmmm

The camera pulls back from the ball to reveal:

<b>78     INT. TROPICAL 7-ELEVEN - DAY			   78
</b>
Theo standing in flowery long Bermuda shorts, matching
airbrush Luau shirt and 7-11 shades. The woman behind the
counter looks like Alfie's twin. (It's actually Alfie in
drag.) It's the same store as before, only with a tropical
motif. Instead of bowling magazines on the rack, there's Mini-
Golf Digest. ALFREDA examines the ball at arm's length,
through her bifocals.

<b>		ALFREDA
</b>	You a mini-golfer?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Nope.

<b>		ALFREDA
</b>	Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new
	putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to
	leave.

<b>		ALFREDA
</b>	Can I get you something for the road?

<b>		THEO
</b>	You have orange whips?

<b>		ALFREDA
</b>	Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?

<b>		THEO
</b>	No. I'm from Akron.

<b>79     EXT. BILLBOARD - DAY				 79
</b>
The billboard fills the frame. It reads "Paradise Putt-Putt",
and underneath: "A heavenly experience." A motorized cheesy-
looking smiling dwarf-angel swings a golden club.

<b>EXT. MINI-GOLF COURSE
</b>
Miniature golf obstacles are bathed in the light of the
setting sun. The camera passes a huge cement centaur
surrounded by astro-carpeting.

<b>		WOMAN (OS)
</b>	I just hold it loosely with both hands?

<b>		MAN (OS)
</b>	That's right, sugar, find the grip that's
	right for you. Then grasp firmly.
	The camera weaves past a five foot pink
	whale with a gaping green mouth leading
	onto a mini-green.

<b>		WOMAN (OS)
</b>	Grasp firmly. Then what?

<b>		MAN (OS)
</b>	Line up where you want it.

<b>		WOMAN (OS)
</b>	Yeah.

<b>		MAN (OS)
</b>	Now swing it out a little to the right...

<b>		WOMAN (OS)
</b>	Like this?

<b>		MAN (OS)
</b>	No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle
	stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead,
	now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes
	around the side of the whale, we see an
	elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports
	coat and white slacks hunched over a
	diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is
	to the camera and he is wearing a
	baseball cap with a plastic halo attached
	to it.

<b>		WOMAN
</b>	Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.

She swings a club, sending a golf ball puttering into a cup.

<b>		MAN
</b>	Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!

<b>		WOMAN
</b>	Yippy!

Theo strides towards the couple. The man under the halo is
(more)

Buzz. He raises the club at the approaching Theo, keeping the
woman in front of him as a shield. The front of Buzz's cap
reads "I'm No Angel."

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Get away from me!

<b>		WOMAN
</b>	Who the hell are you?

<b>		THEO
</b>	Hi Dad.

<b>		WOMAN
</b>	Dad? You said you was single.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	We ain't married no more.

<b>		THEO
</b>	He says that to all his wives.

As she tries to wiggle away from him, the club conks Buzz on
the noodle, squishing his halo.

<b>		WOMAN
</b>		(freeing herself - to Buzz)
	Geez Maynard, is he telling the truth?

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Don't pay him any mind, sweetheart.

<b>		WOMAN
</b>	You're a nice guy, Maynard, but if you
	got two wives - I ain't into no
	polybigamy. Buzz is silent. He takes the
	club out of her hand. She steps away -
	startled - then turns and jogs away. Buzz
	throws down his club in a fury.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Goddam it! I was just about to make a
	love connection. You sure got a way with
	women. You show up, women get away.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(laughs)
	The whole world thinks you're
	underground.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I am underground.

Buzz removes his damaged cap.

<b>		THEO
</b>	It could just as easily have been me in
	that box.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I told you to get lost. You forced
	yourself into this mess, so the mess
	accommodated you.
	Buzz straightens out and carefully
	remolds the bent out of shape halo.

<b>		THEO
</b>	What about bowling?

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(takes a practice swing)
	Bowling died for me years ago. Besides,
	I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.

<b>		THEO
</b>	You're a scumbag.

Buzz pats his hair down and slips the cap back on his head.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I'm a live scumbag.

Theo digs into his pocket and retrieves the golf ball. He
tosses it to Buzz.

<b>		THEO
</b>	Nice knowing you, dad.

Theo turns and walks towards his car. Buzz pauses and walks
after him.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	So, eh, you never saw me. Right?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I never saw you.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Thanks, kid.
		(pause)
	Where are you goin' now?

<b>		THEO
</b>	I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts.
	Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the
	open window.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you
	come work for me.
		(hands Theo his card)
	Just make sure nobody's following you.
	Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of
	the sunset, his halo bouncing in the
	breeze.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>	I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was
	trying to keep you out of this muddle.
	I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh,
	and by the way, I made a call for you
	before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his
	card and scrawl on the back with a gold
	pen.

<b>		BUZZ
</b>		(hands the card back)
	You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling
	Congress a call.
		(taps the card)
	Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's
	expecting you, and he owes me. He'll
	getcha back in like Flynn.
		(pats Theo's cheek)
	Don't say I never gave you nothing.

<b>		THEO
</b>		(cracks a half smile)
	See ya 'round Maynard.

Buzz backs away from the car as Theo peels out in reverse.
Buzz stands and watches as Theo pulls away.

<b>80     EXT. MILES 'O' LANES PARKING LOT - DAY		   80
</b>
The sign has been changed to "SHEILA'S ALLEY." A sparkling
new badass super-chromed Vespa is parked in the handicap
zone. The Barbie and Ken dolls are wired to the headlamp.
They look incredibly worse for the wear. A parking ticket is
nestled between them. Theo's car pulls in nearby.

<b>81     INT. SHEILA'S ALLEY				  81
</b>
Theo walks through the doors and into the alley packed with
serious bowling types. As he walks towards the back of the
alley, several bowlers stop bowling and stare at him in awe.

<b>		LUNA
</b>	Theo! Howya doin'?

Theo walks on. Others greet the conquering hero.

<b>		BOWLER
</b>	Theo! Hey, Theo's back!

<b>		TINA
</b>	Hello there, stranger.

<b>		LITTLE GIRL
</b>		(still crying)
	Waaaaaaaaaaah!

At the far end, we see Sheila, dressed in a fitted jogging
suit, bowling alone on her lane. Bowlers stop and hold their
balls at their sides. Sheila notices the whole alley is
silent. Theo steps up to the lane, bowling ball bag in hand.
As he straps on his wristbrace he peers down the lane and
sees a seven-ten split; mule ears.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>82     BLACKNESS					  82
</b>
A loud ZIP and light spills in through three holes. Three
fingers approach the holes, blocking out the light once more.
With a POP, the fingers leave the holes and the ball hits the
lane with a KLUNK.

<b>LANE
</b>
The camera races towards the pins along the maple boards.

<b>PINS
</b>
Two pins loom in the foreground, one at each edge of the
screen. The ball slams into the right hand pin in super slow
motion with a ROAR. Theo's eyes slowly close. The pin lifts
and hurtles slowly across the frame towards its unsuspecting
fellow pin. Theo's eyes open. With a reverberating EXPLOSION,
the pin is taken out.

<b>83     INT. SHEILA'S ALLEY, THEO & SHEILA		       83
</b>
Theo turns to Sheila and takes her in his arms.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	Very professional.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I am a professional man.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>		(touches his lips)
	Lips still for sale?

<b>		THEO
</b>		(nonchalantly)
	You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw
	in the tongue.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>		(she pulls away, slightly)
	Can you change something this big?

She pulls out a hundred dollar bill.

<b>		THEO
</b>	I don't know.

Sheila stuffs the bill down Theo's pants.

<b>		SHEILA
</b>	You'll owe me.

They smooch big time. One by one, balls drop to the lanes
again and pins start CRASHING.

<b>				        DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>84     EXT. CEMETERY - DAY				  84
</b>
Alfie, hands trembling, lays a tiny wreath on Buzz Fazeli's
grave. The headstone reads, "Maynard 'Buzz' Fazeli 'I Never
Met A Bowler I Didn't Like.'" A muffled watch beeper CHIMES
"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head." The camera pulls up to
show ten headstones laid out in a bowling pin set-up with
Buzz's at the head.

<b>				        DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>85     EXT. MINI-GOLF COURSE				85
</b>
Buzz's silhouette against an orange sunburst sky. He wears
his halo hat. He takes a beautiful PGA-perfect slow motion
fluid golf swing, connecting with a THWAP. As he follows
through, divots of turf dance at his feet. MUSIC swells. He
holds the afterswing pose and gazes after the ball, off into
the distance.
