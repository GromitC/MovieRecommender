<b>      1     INT.  A BIOCHEMICAL LANDSCAPE                            1
</b>
            A violent electrical storm.  Veins of light pulse outward, branching
            off into a spidery network of 

<b>            GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS
</b>
            We are inside a human brain.  A pack of neurons FIRE OFF to the left,
            and rocket their way across synapses to the optic nerve.  Passing the
            eye socket, they speed toward a silky, curvilinear membrane (the
            retina) on which we see an image projected:

<b>            AN UPSIDE DOWN COMPUTER SCREEN
</b>
            Neurons PING into the membrane: the picture suddenly FLIPS RIGHT SIDE
            UP and we follow the light, flashing in a blur through the iris and
            cornea until, exiting the eye we reverse POV and

<b>      2     EXT.  THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT - DAY                      2
</b>
<b>            CLOSE ON A PAIR OF EYES
</b>
            Deep deep blue.  Radiating more intelligence than wisdom.  Inside
            each pupil is the reflection of a COMPUTER SCREEN.  A deferential
            VOICE sounds from off camera.

<b>                                VOICE
</b>                      Professor Pentcho?

<b>      3     INT.  ATOMIC LABORATORIES  (PROFESSOR PAUL PENTCHO) - DAY3
</b>
            Twenty-nine, athletic, owlishly handsome.  

<b>                                VOICE (ARLETTE)
</b>                      Multi-tasking again?

            Pentcho raises his blue eyes from the computer screen and up at
            ARLETTE (50's), his mannish Swiss assistant.  

<b>                                ARLETTE
</b>                      We can start the descent now.  

<b>      4     INT.  THE LABORATORIES (MOVING) - DAY                    4
</b>
<b>            A SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
            as Pentcho and Arlette stride through the facility.  They pass a
            group of green-tagged VISITORS and their Swiss-accented GUIDE.

<b>                                GUIDE
</b>                      Two hundred feet below us is the world's
                      largest particle accelerator...

            His VOICE continues on overlap as they reach a hallway.

<b>                                GUIDE (OC) (CONT'D)
</b>                      27 kilometers in circumference, the beam
                      pipe actually runs beneath the borders of
                      Switzerland and France...

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      Did you get that data off to Braverman at
                      Cal Tech?

            They are facing the CAPSULE/ELEVATOR that leads to the tunnel.

<b>                                ARLETTE
</b>                      Done.

            Next to the elevator, two plants are dying in their pots, their
            growing lamps off.  Pentcho looks around, finds the plug, pushes it
            into the socket.  The lights glow.  He peers at a leaf: a tiny bug
            crawls across...

<b>                                GUIDE (OC)
</b>                      ...at the moment of impact the electrons
                      inside the pipe are travelling six hundred
                      sixty six million miles per --  

<b>                                ARLETTE
</b>                      We need to progress.

            He breaks out of it, swipes his I.D. card.  The capsule doors WHOOSH
            open.  Pentcho nods at the man inside.  This is JACQUE, his accent
            heavily Italian.

<b>                                JACQUE
</b>                      Hey, it is 3-P-O!  P, P, P!  Professore
                      Paulo Pentcho!

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      That's not an official nickname, Jacque.

            Pentcho looks from Jacque to Arlette, who blushes.  Pentcho sits down
            in the heavily consoled captain's chair.

<b>                                JACQUE
</b>                      Beh!  Eets just tun-nel humor.   

            The giant lab disappears from sight as they DROP twenty stories below
            the earth. 

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      Did they recalibrate the 3k turn?  

            Jacque nods.  They hit bottom.  Pentcho keys in data on the console
            computer as the capsule moves LATERALLY on a track parallel to the
            beam pipe, stopping in front of the RF CAVITY, bursting with a
            billion dollars worth of nanotechnology.

<b>                                PENTCHO (CONT'D)

<b>                                JACQUE
</b>                      Benissimo, Professore.  

            ON PENTCHO: a little bored, manning the console.

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      Fifteen seconds Arlette...

<b>      5     INT.  PENTCHO'S BRAIN FIELD - DAY                        5
</b>
            The camera surges forward into Pentcho's eyes:

<b>            DOUBLE CLICK
</b>
            We see an image draw itself on the empty 'page' of the field: 

<b>            A BLACK DOT LOOPING INTO A STRING
</b>
            accompanied by the following thought text:  
                      "...two spatially separated particles will
                      irresistibly attract..."

<b>            MOUSE CLICK - A WOMAN'S FACE
</b>
            wide-set brown eyes brimming with emotion.  A hint of a SONG playing
            somewhere in the BG.  

<b>            MOUSE CLICK
</b>
            to the previous 'page' where the LOOP has formed into a sheet moving
            through space, followed by the floating thought text: 
                      "...until the force of the collision fuses
                      them into..."

<b>                                PENTCHO'S VOICE
</b>                      Ten, nine, eight...

<b>            MOUSE CLICK - POV: LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN AT
</b>
            the BROWN-EYED WOMAN, her face dreamy, her body naked beneath silk
            sheets.  PULL BACK: she's floating on an enormous Renaissance mural -
            a wedding scene - that is a bedroom floor.  Off in the corner,
            PENTCHO sits hunched over a clunky laptop, his fingers dancing,
            dervish-like, across the keyboard.

<b>                                PENTCHO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>                      Four, three, two...

<b>                                WOMAN
</b>                      Then goodbye...

            CRACK!  Suddenly, the woman drifts away.  Pentcho looks up: THEIR
<b>            EYES LOCK WITH LONGING AS:
</b>
<b>      6     INT.  THE CAPSULE CONSOLE - SAME TIME                    6
</b>
            Pentcho's FINGER depresses the START button. 

<b>      7     INT.  PARTICLE ACCELERATOR - DAY                         7
</b>
            as we follow the PULSE SIGNAL from the keyboard to the CPU, across
            the LOCAL AREA NETWORK to the MAINFRAME in the RF cavity, sending its
            own signal into the BEAM PIPE, where two soon-to-be accelerated
            ELECTRONS are released,  like horses bolting from the same starting
            gate, but in opposite directions.  THE ROLLER-COASTER RIDE BEGINS. 

<b>            POV - ONE LIGHT INFUSED ELECTRON 
</b>
            BLASTING through the beam pipe like a COMET, fused inside of a
            looping, twenty seven kilometer single lane race track. WHOOOSH!

            As the electron accelerates, so too does the sound, rushing to GUT
            SPLITTING, EAR WRENCHING DB'S.  Heading around the turn, it barrels
            STRAIGHT INTO THE PATH OF THE SECOND ELECTRON on its own speed-of
            light power surge.

            HERE COMES THE IMPACT POINT... but SCREEEEECH!  

            What disc brakes might sound like, slammed to the floor of a vehicle
            travelling six hundred sixty six million miles per hour.

<b>            SUDDENLY THE ELECTRON HAS STOPPED, SUSPENDED,
</b>
            its phosphorescent glow trained like a spotlight on:

<b>            PENTCHO - EXTREME CLOSE UP
</b>
            the dual computer screens reflecting out of his pupils, again.  A
            VOICE speaks from nowhere, sonorous and packed with reverb:

<b>                                FEMALE VOICE
</b><b>                      WHAT DO YOU WANT?
</b>
            The camera SURGES into Pentcho's eyes as the brain field opens to the
            sounds of a nine alarm fire.  DING DING DING DING DING! The thought
            text marches by in giant, attention-getting letters: "ELECTRONS DON'T
<b>            TALK!"
</b>
<b>                                FEMALE VOICE (CONT) (CONT'D)
</b><b>                      WHAT DO YOU WANT, PAUL?
</b>
            More thought text scrolls by on the field, now in RED LETTERS:
                      "I'm having a psychotic episode."

            The field collapses back into PENTCHO, ashen-faced, watching his
            computer screen, and seeing: the cursor (electron) blinking.

<b>                                JACQUE'S VOICE
</b>                      Impact!

            Suddenly, we are back inside the pipe, HURTLING toward

<b>            KABLOOM!  THE SUB-ATOMIC EXPLOSION
</b>
            A particle meteor shower of magnificent proportions.  They glow and
            charge off and disappear, as the laws of E=mc2 take visual flight
            inside this billion dollar kaleidoscope.

            still behind the air bag/steering wheel, craning his stiffening neck
            forward and back at the crumpled row of red automobiles.  He blinks,

            Pentcho clips a safety line to his belt.  The two of them wear 
            yellow hardhats and climbing harnesses.  They suddenly KICK OFF the
            scaffold and DANGLE twenty five feet above the stone floor.  Hand

            Pentcho's already there.  He kicks his legs out.  Joyrides on the tug

            Pentcho reaches out to kiss her.  Doesn't see that their collision
            has jogged the clutch on his harness rope.  Now it opens all the way.

            In an instant, he's gripping air, FALLING at the speed of Newton's

            He hurtles downward in slow motion.  There's a SOUND rushing in
            behind him, the RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE.  

            Pentcho catches a glimpse up over his shoulder: the angels, the

            They camp on old couch cushions, side by side, staring up at the
            illuminated fresco.  Pentcho is bruised, battered, vulnerable.  

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      When I was a kid I used to snap my head back
                      like a gunfighter on the draw, hoping to
                      catch a glimpse behind me.  

            Mia props her head up on one elbow.

                      Mia. 

            It's a plea.  She turns, stares directly into his eyes.

</b>                      The universe is snapping my head back.  I'm

</b>                      Welcome, Paul.  Welcome.  

            She traces a line from his forehead to the bridge of his nose,
            quoting Yeats (from "The Second Coming") as a celebration:

<b>                                MIA (CONT'D)

                      hold.  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the
                      world."

            He pulls her close to him.  They lie, spooned together, breathing in
            unison, gazing up at the painted heaven.  

            A firefly enters from outside, flutters in the air above them,
            blushing a trace line of yellow light.

</b>                      That's what it asked me.  "What do you
                      want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the
                      middle of an experiment.

<b>                                MIA

            He hesitates, then surrenders to the fact.

</b>                      Yes.  

            The firefly dances above them.  Pentcho sits up (and away from her). 
            Mock serious:

            Mia notes his distance.  Faces him, cross-legged.

</b>                      No.  I didn't.  (dryly) I'm listening.

            The Durango pulls up, stops.  Pentcho gets deposited on the curb. 
            Barely closes the door before the car SPEEDS away.  He looks up. 
            Sees the sign on the bus stop bench:

            A taxi stops in front of a two story cottage, looking abandoned in
            the wet weather.  Pentcho walks out, passing his dented VW BEETLE in
            the driveway.  Ascends a flight of brick steps to the:

</b>
            An alternately stark and cluttered space, less lived in than occupied
            by a man on the run between his office and his mind.

            Rivulets of water run from an open window, across a large desk, and
            down onto the wood floor.  Pentcho scans around, unfazed.  Locates a
            towel.  Mops up.  Dries off the computer and keyboard.  Bag still on
            his shoulder, he fires up the machine and logs

            E-mail.  Lots of it.  Hundreds and hundreds of messages scrolling by
            on the screen.  He turns away, sees his own rain soaked clothes
            forming a puddle on the floor.  LIGHTNING cascades across the sky,
            visible through the large bay window behind the desk.  Pentcho's eyes
            stray back to the screen

<b>            STILL SCROLLING E-MAIL MESSAGES

            as the thunder follows almost immediately.  CRACK!  He looks up: 
            Veins of light pulse outward, branching into a spidery network

            light path straight at...

            wild, white Einstein hair.  He CLUTCHES suddenly at his chest, like a

            Ditto the neighborhood.  A 7-Eleven sign blinks on the corner.
            Pentcho walks up the cracked sidewalk to a sagging wooden porch.  
            Looks for signs of life.  A light.  Something.  

            He pushes on the front door.  Locked.  Rummages through his key ring
            in the dark.  Slides one into the top lock.  Won't turn.
            Tries another key.  Gets stuck.  He pulls it out.  Presses his face
            close against the window.

</b>                      The restorer...

            Now he wanders off, disappears into the dark.

            ON PENTCHO: wired, incredulous, heart thump thump thumping.  

            He calls out after his father.  

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      I need some air. (beat) Don't shoot me.

</b>                      Good night.  

<b>            INT.  ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - A SHORT TIME LATER
</b>
            Pentcho paces in front of the open window, stops.  He turns to walk
            out, is surprised by

<b>            ALEXANDER
</b>
            Standing in the dark.

<b>                                ALEXANDER
</b>                      We've been kidding ourselves, Pauly.  Until
                      you look for it, it doesn't even exist.  

<b>     45     EXT.  SAN PEDRO WHARF - NIGHT                           45
</b>
            Pentcho slogs down the wharf.  Running from it.  Looking for it. 
            Past homeless people slipping in and out of the shadows.  He snaps
            his head back over his shoulder, sees an OLD WOMAN playing  the
            accordian.  She stops.  Her eyes bore in on his own. 

<b>                                OLD WOMAN
</b>                      You would have a son with me...

            Pentcho blinks.  The woman is suddenly FIFTY YEARS YOUNGER:

<b>                                YOUNG OLD WOMAN
</b>                      ...and his name would be Hope.

<b>     46     INT.  PENTCHO'S BRAIN - (A MATHEMATICAL FORMULA)        46
</b>
            Numbers fly up on the field, are inscribed, erased, considered and
            measured.  Pentcho's own VOICE is heard on overlap:

<b>                                PENTCHO'S VOICE
</b>                      "If you could look back fast enough, at near
                      to the speed of light, then there would be
                      no reality behind you, because it hadn't yet
                      been created --

<b>     47     EXT.  THE WHARF - (A FOGHORN) NIGHT                     47
</b>
            BELLOWS in the dark.  Pentcho twists his head forward, spots:

<b>            A PINK NEON HEART
</b>
            blinking above a tatto parlor.  His eyes lock on, see the heart 

<b>            GLOWING BIGGER AND BIGGER, 
</b>
            its electric pulse mimicing the beating of a real organ.  

<b>            CLOSER STILL - ON PENTCHO
</b>
            Running from it.  Looking for it.  He stops dead in his tracks, tries
            one last time to play gunfighter with the quantum reality:

<b>            HE SNAPS HIS HEAD BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER
</b>
            and we see him, making the same move, from four different camera
            angles: from his LEFT, his RIGHT, from the TOP OF HIS HEAD, and
            looking up FROM GROUND ZERO as 

<b>            HE FINALLY WINS THE DRAW.
</b>
            The RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE is unleashed.   Here it comes,
            rolling in with a giant WHOOSHING SOUND...

<b>            POV PENTCHO: WATCHING REALITY SUCKED OUT OF EXISTENCE
</b>
            The ships, the dock, the harbor OBLITERATED by an onrushing,
            transparent cloud of NOTHINGNESS, EMPTINESS, a tabula rasa
            superimposed upon the disappeared wharf.  

<b>            ON PENTCHO, FALLING TO HIS KNEES
</b>
            hammered by his own victory, numb from shock and ecstasy, staring
            into the void as we surge forward 

<b>     48     INT.  THE BRAIN FIELD                                   48
</b>
            It's completely blank, just like the void.  The VITALS are flatlined. 
            A single piece of thought text floats across the emptiness, almost
            like a screen saver:
                      Say Uncle.... Say Uncle...

<b>     49     EXT.  THE WHARF - (A VOICE) - NIGHT                     49

<b>                                VOICE
</b>                      Uncle, hey... 

            A face, peering down at Pentcho.  The face belongs to the MAGIC MAN,
            in a mad hatter hat, and a potpourri of found item clothing.  Like a
            Baptist preacher on his sidewalk pulpit:

<b>                                MAGIC MAN
</b>                      Can you feel it, uncle?  Can you feel it
                      right down to your bones?!  

<b>            ON PENTCHO: EXTREME CLOSE UP
</b>
            Inside each pupil is the reflection of the NEON HEART.  We pull back
            on Pentcho's face.  Calm.  Serene.

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      Yes.  (beat) Yes I can.

<b>     50     EXT.  ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - NIGHT                         50
</b>
            Pentcho turns the key, effortlessly opens the front door.

<b>            INT.  UPSTAIRS HOUSE - AN ORNATE TILE SHOWER - NIGHT
</b>
            He stands beneath the stream of hot water, cleansing himself of a day
            that began a very long time ago.

<b>            INT.  THE GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
            Pentcho dresses, taking in the smell and texture of fresh clothes
            against his body.  He sits down on the bed.  Sees a clock.  5:00 a.m. 
            TUGS UP one of the double sash windows that faces the 7-Eleven. 
            VOICES rise from the parking lot.  

            Pentcho stretches out on the musty bedspread, eyes on the carved
            plaster ceiling.  Suddenly, floating up through the open window:  

<b>                                WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>                      What do you want?!  

            Pentcho cranes his head.

<b>                                WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>                      Tell me!  Now!  Now!  

            The old sash falls shut.  BOOM.  It's like a dam bursting inside him,
            only the flood is LAUGHTER that starts deep in his belly, as a
            giggle, then a chuckle that cascades upward and out into enormous
            GUFFAWS.  The sound rocks the house.  Pentcho's smile is a mile wide. 
            His eyes sparkle, then tear up as the

<b>            FRONT DOORBELL RINGS
</b>
            He jumps off the bed, and bounds down the stairs.  

<b>     53     INT. THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT                             53
</b>
            Alexander's already there, ushering MIA inside to:

<b>     54     INT.  THE LIVING ROOM - AT THE MOMENT THAT              54
</b>
            Pentcho arrives.  He stops, incredulous, at the sight of her.  

<b>                                ALEXANDER
</b>                      Guess who's coming to dinner.

            Mia jumps right in.  To Pentcho:

<b>                                MIA
</b>                      I didn't want to leave things the way we
                      did.  Not this time.

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      Wait.  I want to tell you something.

            He takes her arm, steering her away from Alexander, into the living
            room.  She stops cold at the sight of the MURAL.

<b>                                MIA
</b>                      I've been dreaming about this.

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                          (excited)
                      Then you get it.  You'll understand.

<b>                                MIA
</b>                      What?

            His face has the look of the little boy who has just stumbled upon
            the pirate's treasure.  

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      I know what I want.  I let go, and a second
                      later you materialized at the door.  You
                      see?  

<b>            CLOSE ON PENTCHO
</b>
            feeling the feelings.

<b>                                PENTCHO (CONT'D)
</b>                      Mia.  I can create reality.  (beat) I can
                      choose to love you with all my heart.  

            Tears pool along the rims of her eyes.  She stares straight at him,
            hiding nothing.

<b>                                MIA
</b>                      You know those people who won't be
                      photographed because they're afraid you're
                      stealing their souls...?  
                          (long beat)
                      I came to take back my picture.  The one I
                      keep leaving with you.

            His heart deflates.  His voice follows.  Barely audible:

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      Why?

<b>                                MIA
</b>                      So I can move on.  You too.

            A horn blares from outside.

<b>                                MIA (CONT'D)
</b>                      Be who you are, Paul.  I love who you are. 
                      I do.

            She turns and runs out the front door.

<b>     55     EXT.  ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT         55
</b>
            Mia runs down to the curb where where boyfriend WILL holds open the
            passenger door of the red Durango.

<b>                                MIA'S VOICE
</b>                      I'll drive.

            She circles the car, disappears behind the wheel.  Will gets in his
            side.  

<b>            ON THE FRONT PORCH
</b>
            Pentcho, agitated, pushes open the door.  Alexander's already
            outside, watching Mia motor off.  He turns, stares at his son.

<b>                                ALEXANDER
</b>                      Do you want to think about it some more?  

            PENTCHO SPRINTS DOWN TO THE CURB.  Jumps into the Beetle.  The
            headlights FLASH ON in the pre-dawn night.

<b>     56     INT.  THE DURANGO (DRIVING) - NIGHT                     56
</b>
            Mia grips the wheel with two hands.  Will feigns nonchalance. 

<b>                                WILL
</b>                      You okay?

            She nods.  Barely.  They merge onto the highway. 

<b>     57     INT.  THE BEETLE (DRIVING) - NIGHT                      57
</b>
            Pentcho grips the wheel.  Eyes focused.  We surge into 

<b>     58     INT.  PENTCHO'S BRAIN FIELD - OPENING ON                58
</b>
<b>            PEARLS, PLAYING OUT, LOOPING INTO A STRING 
</b>
            whose shape recalls the original brain field.  Thought text scrolls
            below, accompanied now by Pentcho's own inner voice.

<b>                                VOICE AND TEXT
</b>                      Each part of physical reality is constructed
                      of all the other parts...

<b>            EXTREME CLOSE-UP, ON A SINGLE PEARL
</b>
            inside of which, the entire strand is reflected.

<b>                                VOICE AND TEXT (CONT'D)
</b>                      A web of connections created by the
                      interdependence of all things...

            The field collapses back into:

<b>     59     INT.  MIA IN THE DURANGO (DRIVING) - NIGHT              59
</b>
            eyes on the rear view mirror, as a horn BLARES from the entrance to
            the Long Beach bridge.

            She re-checks the mirror, filled with bobbing headlight beams.  One
            beam LOCKS ON, straight into the center of the glass, blinding her
            for a split second.  She blinks.  Gasps to herself as the beam seems
            to 

<b>            LIFT OUT OF HER MIRROR 
</b>
            and train its phosphorescent glow on:

<b>            MIA - EXTREME CLOSE UP
</b>
            the point of light reflecting out of her pupils.  PENTCHO'S VOICE
            speaks from nowhere, sonorous and packed with reverb:

<b>                                PENTCHO'S VOICE
</b>                      What do you want?

            Mia blinks again.  The beam is gone.  She looks over at WILL,
            oblivious, checking his watch. 

<b>            BACK ON MIA
</b>
            the understanding flooding her eyes as 

<b>            SHE SNAPS HER HEAD BACK (JUST LIKE PENTCHO THE GUNFIGHTER)
</b>
            And we see her making her move from FOUR DIFFERENT CAMERA ANGLES,
            from her left, right, up above, and from the back seat of the car as
            the RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE WHOOSHES BY...

<b>            POV MIA: THE BRIDGE, THE CARS, THE BAY
</b>
            all sucked out of existence until nothing remains but         

<b>            THE VOID.  NOTHINGNESS.  NADA.   CRASH!
</b>
<b>     60     INT.  THE DURANGO (SLAMMING INTO THE CAR AHEAD) - NIGHT 60
</b>
            triggering a chain reaction of vehicles fish-tailing across the
            bridge.  In quick succession come a STREAM OF IMAGES:

            The pearls colliding...

            Mia and Will exchanging a LOOK...

            Traffic HALTING on the bridge...

            Will getting SCORCHED by the MAN they plowed into...

            Mia, exiting her side, looking BACK BEHIND HER...

            PENTCHO, ditching his Beetle, ten car lengths south...

            HE RUNS FORWARD, straight down the path of a tunnel-like headlight
            beam.  

            MIA PICKS UP SPEED, churning from the other direction.  

<b>            PULL BACK: FROM THE BRIDGE
</b>
            as the two of them move toward the same point.  Suddenly, tiny sparks
            of light GLOW and JUMP from portions of the bridge cable.

<b>            SLOW MOTION: PENTCHO AND MIA
</b>
            gliding still closer.  A VOICE sounds:

<b>                                VOICE
</b>                      Impact!

            Their bodies CONNECT, arms intertwine, lips touch lips...

<b>            PULL BACK - HIGHER
</b>
            It's like a plug in the socket of the physical landscape

            pulsing outward into a spidery network of
