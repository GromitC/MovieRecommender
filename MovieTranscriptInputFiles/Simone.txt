</b>	                         Andrew Niccol
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	----------------------------------------------------------------
</b><b>	
</b><b>	FADE IN:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	ON BRIGHT, OUT-OF-FOCUS, OVAL-SHAPED COLORS.
</b><b>	
</b>	The colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression
	of looking through a kaleidoscope.
<b>	
</b>	As the image comes into sharp focus, we discover that we are
	inside a CANDY BOWL.  A MAN'S FINGERS are frantically
	removing all the cherry-flavored pieces of candy.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The man performing this curious task is
	writer/producer/director, VIKTOR TARANSKY, forties,
	conservatively dressed in suit and tie.  He sits alone at an
	empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage,
	some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows
	the table's paper cloth.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor finishes sorting.  Finding no trash can to deposit the
	rejected cherry candy, he scoops them into his pocket.
<b>	
</b>	A young headset-clad P.A. hurriedly approaches.  He looks
	ill.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    P.A.
</b>	          Mr. Taransky --
<b>	
</b>	Viktor reads the young P.A.'s panicked expression.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          She's walking?... Don't tell me
	          she's walking.
	              (blood slowly draining
	               from his face)
	          She is not walking... She can't
	          walk.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  TRAILER - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	NICOLA ANDERS, twenty-something, A-list actress, beautiful
	face scowling, is supervising her ASSISTANT ferrying clothes
	from a movie trailer to a limousine.  VIKTOR desperately
	follows after Nicola.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          -- Nicola!  How was your massage?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    NICOLA
</b>	          You're in breach.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          -- Is this about the new pages? --
	          I made the changes you wanted,
	          you're in virtually every scene --
<b>	
</b><b>	                    NICOLA
</b>	              (wheeling on him)
	          It's not the size of the role,
	          Viktor.
	              (suddenly very cool)
	          Am I or am I not contractually
	          entitled to the biggest trailer on
	          the set?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (regarding the enormous
	               silver fish behind them,
	               confused)
	          It's the biggest on earth!  I
	          swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream --
	          they don't make them any longer
	          than that.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    NICOLA
</b>	          Taller, Viktor.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Taller?  What?
<b>	
</b>	Viktor looks up in horror.  The trailer next to Nicola's does
	indeed appear to be fractionally taller.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    NICOLA
</b>	              (walking away)
	          You've insulted me for the last
	          time.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor looks to the tires.  His face suddenly brightens.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Nicola, it's just the tires --
	          they're over-inflated!  I can fix
	          it!
<b>	
</b>	Viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately
	stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen.  Air hisses out.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          See, it's lower already.
<b>	
</b>	Nicola ignores Viktor, marching towards her limo with her
	PUBLICIST.  Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          I beg you.  You can't do this to
	          me.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    NICOLA
</b>	              (looking back)
	          I had three other offers.  I only
	          signed on to this picture out of...
	          loyalty.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Then show some.  They'll shut me
	          down!
<b>	
</b><b>	                    NICOLA
</b>	              (opening the car door)
	          It wasn't working anyhow.  The
	          scene with the thousand geese -- I
	          don't understand this film.  I
	          don't think anyone will understand
	          it.  I already put out a press
	          release -- citing "creative
	          differences".
<b>	
</b>	Viktor stops, nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          You know what, Nicola, you're
	          right.
	              (picking up her last piece
	               of luggage)
	          Here, let me help you with that.
	              (holding the door for her)
	          You ought to go.  The truth is I
	          don't deserve you.  This film
	          doesn't deserve you.  Frankly, it
	          deserves much, much better.  The
	          reason it's not working is because
	          you're not about the work.
<b>	
</b>	Nicola is stunned.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (to the limo driver)
	          To Hell, please.
<b>	
</b>	The door slams and the limo roars away.  Viktor looks to the
	still hissing trailer tire.  The CREW regards Viktor
	apprehensively.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (to the crew)
	          What are you looking at?  Get back
	          to work.
<b>	
</b>	The crew is uncertain what work there is to do.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	In an ornate bedroom, NICOLA lies on her death bed under a
	veil of netting.  A distraught man, HAL, sits close by.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    NICOLA
</b>	              (whispered)
	          Jack... are you there?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HAL
</b>	          I'm here.  I'm right beside you.
<b>	
</b>	A NUN enters.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    NUN
</b>	              (to Hal)
	          You should really go now.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    NICOLA
</b>	          No, it's alright.  Please, let him
	          stay.
<b>	
</b>	The nun withdraws.  Hal holds his face in his hands, almost
	breaking down.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HAL
</b>	              (a glance to heaven)
	          What kind of cruel God is it that
	          would take you away from me?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    NICOLA
</b>	          The same one who brought me to you.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HAL
</b>	          No... I cannot accept it.  If
	          something like this can happen. 
	          What...
	              (struggling to find the
	               words)
	          What is it for?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    NICOLA
</b>	              (smiles through her pain)
	          -- Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here.
<b>	
</b>	Nicola dies peacefully.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR sits with leading man HAL, THREE EXECUTIVES and studio
	head ELAINE CHRISTIAN, watching a rough assembly of the film. 
	It ends with a close up of NICOLA ANDERS.
<b>	
</b>	The lights go up.  The image of Nicola fades off the screen.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    EXECUTIVE 1
</b>	          She's good.  You can hardly tell
	          she's reading off a teleprompter.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (ignoring him)
	          I've analyzed the footage.  We've
	          got almost everything we need in
	          the can.  If we rework the script,
	          we can finish the film without her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    EXECUTIVE 2
</b>	              (forceful shake of the
	               head)
	          According to the writ her attorneys
	          filed at noon today.  They'll sue
	          if the film is released with Nicola
	          in a single frame.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (more anxious)
	          So we'll re-cast.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HAL
</b>	          Nicola Anders is the only actress
	          who can play that role.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (incredulous)
	          It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not
	          bigger than this picture.
<b>	
</b>	Elaine finally speaks up.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          Of course she is.  No other name is
	          going to sign on now and risk
	          offending her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          We don't need a name.  We'll cast
	          an unknown.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HAL
</b>	          I won't play opposite an unknown.

</b>	A huge eye from a dismantled Nicola Anders billboard is
	wheeled away behind him -- followed by a huge pair of lips.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A sea of ingenue headshots.  Black X's are drawn through all
	of them.  VIKTOR lies amongst the rejected faces, talking on
	the telephone, in his spartan bachelor beach house.

<b>	
</b>	Sharp knock on his door.  Viktor peers through a curtain and
	spies an official-looking MAN IN A SUIT, carrying what looks
	to be a legal notice in his hands.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor slips out of the back door.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  BEACH - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR hurries along the beach.  When he turns, he discovers
	the MAN IN THE SUIT following him.  As Viktor runs, the Suit
	runs -- calling out to him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAN IN THE SUIT

</b>	              (calling back)
	          I'm not him.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor stumbles.  When he recovers, the Suit is on him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
</b>	          Mr. Taransky, Sir, I represent the
	          estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
	              (showing him Hank's
	               obituary in the L.A. 
	               Times)
	          It was Mr. Aleno's last wish that
	          you have this.
<b>	
</b>	The Suit hands Viktor a heavily-sealed envelope.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          What is it?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
</b>	          I have no idea, Sir.  He wanted you
	          to have it.
<b>	
</b>	The Suit departs.  Viktor hesitates, then breaks the seal on
	the package -- inside he finds a hard-drive.  The hard-drive
	is labeled "SIMULATION ONE".
<b>	
</b><b>	A TITLE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                      SIX MONTHS LATER
</b><b>	
</b><b>	CLOSE UP ON
</b><b>	
</b>	a VACUUM CLEANER cleaning a tatty red carpet.
<b>	
</b>	On the other end of the vacuum cleaner is VIKTOR.  The red
	carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the
	venue for the premiere of "SUNRISE, SUNSET".  To save money
	on posters, Viktor has altered the originals, "Starring
	NICOLA ANDERS" crudely pasted over with "Introducing SIMONE".
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - DUSK
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR regards the sad, little premiere.  No paparazzi, no
	limos, no klieg lights.  Resorting to giving away tickets to
	PASSERS-BY, Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in
	trash.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Want to see a free movie?

</b><b>	                    HOMELESS MAN
</b>	              (he thinks)
	          No.
<b>	
</b>	A taxi pulls up.  Viktor's daughter, LAINEY, steps out.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	              (kissing him hello)
	          Hi, Dad.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Hello, Lainey.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesn't have quite enough
	cash.  Lainey pays herself.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Your mother couldn't make it?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          She's at the premiere of "A Cold
	          Day In Hell".  But I think she send
	          someone from Acquisitions.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          This week anyhow.
<b>	
</b>	VIKTOR escorts Lainey down the empty red carpet, regarding
	the pathetic premiere.  As they walk by, the bulb in Viktor's
	sole spotlight expires.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Not quite how I imagined it --

	               side)
	          -- You finished the film on your

	          yourself?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          There was no other way.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          I missed you.  I wondered if you
	          were ever coming back.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Me too.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	              (regarding the makeshift
	               poster, trying to lift
	               his spirits)
	          Well, I can't wait to meet
	          Simone... what's her last name?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          You know, I... don't know.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          Is she here tonight?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          She can't watch herself.
<b>	
</b>	They are interrupted by the THEATER OWNER.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    THEATER OWNER
</b>	          -- Hey, we have to start.  I've got
	          "Tough Love 2" playing at ten.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  PIER - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	A foggy, empty pier.  A MAN is running through the mist,
	shouting desperately.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HAL
</b>	          Valarie!  VALARIE!
<b>	
</b>	Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and
	hood, her back to us.  The camera pushes in, music swells and
	she turns.  SIMONE.  She is exquisitely, ethereally
	beautiful.  Perfect.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	In the near-empty, dilapidated theater, "SUNRISE, SUNSET" is
	playing ON THE SCREEN.
<b>	
</b>	When Simone's face appears, the faces of the AUDIENCE MEMBERS
	change.  They are all visibly moved, including the THEATER
	OWNER.  Some weeping, some with curious smiles on their
	faces, some opened-mouthed.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HAL
</b>	              (ON SCREEN, approaching)
	          Valarie, what are you running from?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	              (enigmatic smile)
	          From Valarie.
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly a GUNSHOT rings out.  Simone collapses to the
	ground.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HAL
</b>	              (running to her)
	          Valarie!  No!
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR, unable to watch, paces up and down, chain-smoking
	while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth.  Viktor finally
	musters the courage to look inside the auditorium.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	The same scene that played in the studio screening room. 
	However now when we cut from the leading man, HAL, to the
	leading lady it is not NICOLA but the newly cast SIMONE.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	          -- Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	ON SCREEN SIMONE lies dying.  Now even LAINEY is affected by
	Simone's performance.  She wipes a tear from her eye.
<b>	
</b>	VIKTOR watches the backs of the heads, trying to gauge the
	audience reaction.  Finally the credits roll.
<b>	
</b>	A dedication, "For HANK".
<b>	
</b>	No one moves from their seats.  Viktor permits himself a
	brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the
	credits:
<b>	
</b>	                 A Film By VIKTOR TARANSKY
<b>	
</b>	Still no one moves from their seats.  Viktor cannot stand it
	any longer.  He runs to the restroom.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  THEATER RESTROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Face over the stained sink, VIKTOR splashes himself with
	water.  He looks to the mirror, horrified by his own
	reflection.  He rehearses a courtroom speech.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I
	          may be guilty of a crime, but it
	          was committed with the purest of
	          intentions, to send a message to
	          the acting community who put
	          themselves above the work and
	          above --
<b>	
</b>	Three AUDIENCE MEMBERS enter the restroom.  They approach the
	urinals.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
</b>	              (continuing their
	               conversation from the
	               lobby)
	          -- So fake.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
</b>	          -- Totally artificial.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits, missing
	the end of their conversation.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
</b>	          We're really supposed to believe
	          that was 19th Century Lisbon?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 3
</b>	          Who's looking at the sets when she
	          is on the screen?
<b>	
</b>	All three nod in agreement and begin to urinate.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR exits the restroom.  Almost all the AUDIENCE MEMBERS,
	including LAINEY, are waiting for him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	              (pointing out her father)
	          There he is.  That's my dad, Viktor
	          Taransky.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group
	spontaneously applauds.  They rush to shake his hand.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 4
</b>	          -- She is magnificent.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 5

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          She wasn't too... cartoony?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 6

<b>	
</b><b>	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 7

</b><b>	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 9
</b>	          -- Congratulations again.  She

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

	          putting it.  And the film as a

<b>	
</b>	The group drifts away, leaving LAINEY and VIKTOR alone.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY

	              (quickly changing tack)
	          Have you read the reviews?  They're
	          love letters.
	              (reading from a newspaper)
	          Listen to this one.  "Simone has
	          the voice of a young Jane Fonda,

</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          As I say, she's... something of a
	          recluse.  That's how she's able to
	          stay so pure -- by isolating
	          herself in her art.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE

	          Leave the press conference to me.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor strides up the studio steps.  Elaine stares after her
	ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound
	arrogance.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  STUDIO - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY

</b>	The studio soundstages as a backdrop, VIKTOR approaches a
	podium and a forest of microphones, revelling in his recent

</b>	          I remember when the Echo had class

<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          Our leaders aren't presidents

	          with you?  I don't want you to take
	          this the wrong way, Viktor, but

</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Let it burn.  Simone would rather
	          go up in flames than give up her
	          privacy.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters
	the soundstage.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for
	a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a
	tablet attached to a large, projection screen monitor and two
	side monitors.  VIKTOR takes a seat in front of the monitor.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (to himself as he inserts
	               his Hollywood hard-drive 
<b>	               -- SIMULATION ONE)
</b>	          Pay no attention to the man behind
	          the computer.
<b>	
</b>	A title appears on his computer screen.
<b>	
</b>	                          Welcome
	                             to
<b>	                       SIMULATION ONE
</b><b>	
</b>	With a satisfied smile, Viktor backspaces characters until he
	revises the title to:
<b>	
</b>	                          Welcome
	                             to
<b>	                           SIMONE
</b><b>	
</b>	He presses "ENTER" and a face begins to build -- wire upon
	wire, pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian
	emerges -- SIMONE.  She is indistinguishable from a flesh-and
	blood actress.
<b>	
</b>	Simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background --
	titled "VISUAL LOOP 6".  Within the confines of the monitor
	she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal.  She looks a
	little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for
	too long.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (to the screen)
	          Good morning, Simone.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
</b>	          Good morning, Mr. Taransky.

<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
</b>	          ... digitized.
<b>	
</b>	Only now do we observe that Viktor is occasionally talking
	into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a
	key on his keyboard.  When he speaks, she speaks.  Simone's
	voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to
	Viktor's voice.  A scanning light on Viktor allows Simone to
	mimic his movements.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
</b>	          You mean they buy it?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (nervous smile as he
	               examines his first
	               royalty check)
	          Buy it?  They're paying for it. 
	          And around here that's how you
	          really know they buy it.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to
	the terminal -- from the "L.A. Times" obituaries.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          I'm only sorry Hank isn't here to
	          see this.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor looks up, Simone mimicking his action.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
</b>	              (depressing the button
	               every time he wants to
	               express his thoughts

	          Maybe he can.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Do you have any idea what this
	          means, Simone?  Our ability to
	          manufacture fraud now exceeds our
	          ability to detect it.

	          You are birth of... what?  A
	          Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era
	          in show business.  All I wanted to
	          do was finish the film.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR

	          And now look what you've started. 
	          And now look what you've started.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor's conversation with himself is not merely for his own
	amusement.  He is adjusting and refining Simone's voice.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Hmm... a little less Streep, a
	          little more Bacall.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars, living and
	dead, that comprise Simone.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen
	dedicated to Simone's audio, incorporating the vocal
	deliveries -- "20% STREEP, 80% BACALL".
<b>	
</b>	He speaks once again as Simone to test the adjustment.  The
	voice patterns appear on his screen -- graphic
	representations of the sound waves.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
</b>	          Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Yes.  Yes, it is.
<b>	
</b>	VIKTOR snaps back to reality himself.  He scrolls through the
	list of screen legends.  He clicks on the image of AUDREY
<b>	HEPBURN.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          While I think of it, I'd like you
	          to add something to your repertoire
	          -- remember that thing Hepburn does
	          in "Breakfast At Tiffany's".
<b>	
</b>	A clip of AUDREY HEPBURN in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" plays on
	the screen.  Hepburn, sitting on a fire escape, looks up.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    AUDREY HEPBURN
</b>	              (from the screen, an
	               incomparable smile)
	          Hi.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (pausing the moment)
	          Let's hear you say "Hi" like
	          Audrey.
<b>	
</b>	With a CUT and PASTE, Viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly
	into a frozen Simone.  Viktor presses play.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	              (imitating Audrey's
	               performance perfectly)
	          Hi.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Perfect.
	              (stretching)
	          God, I'm so relaxed around you.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
</b>	          You did create me.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          No.  I... just helped bring someone
	          else's dream to life.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
</b>	          Mr. Taransky, we both know I was
	          nothing without you.  I was
	          computer code -- ones and zeros.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          You're right.  You're right.  Of
	          course, one doesn't want to boast. 
	          It's a classic case of technology
	          in search of an artist.  That's all
	          you've been waiting for, an artist
	          with integrity, with a vision, who
	          can see.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor gets up and starts walking around the room, warming to
	his theme.  SIMONE moves in a VISUAL LOOP on the monitor,
	nodding attentively as if she's really interested.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          See beyond that irrational
	          allegiance to flesh and blood. --
	          See that with the rise in price of
	          a real actor and the fall in price
	          of a fake, the scales have tipped
	          in favor of the fake.
	              (voice raising in
	               excitement)
	          -- See that if the performance is
	          genuine, it doesn't matter if the
	          actor is real.  Once a performance
	          is committed to film, the blood and
	          bones are gone anyway.  Only the
	          spirit, the illusion remains. 
	          Besides, what's real anymore? 
	          These days most actors have digital
	          work done to them so it's a gray
	          area.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
</b>	              (Simone appears to look
	               directly at her maker)
	          Are you ever going to tell the
	          truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          The only real truth is in the work.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
</b>	          You know what I'm talking about.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the
	          truth about you, why wouldn't I...?
	              (pondering his own
	               question)
	          Of course, with Hank's tragic
	          passing, the secret died with him.
	              (shaking the thought from
	               his head)
	          I am going to tell the truth...
	          after your next picture.
<b>	
</b>	Feeling uneasy at the prospect, Viktor changes the subject. 
	He pulls out his script for "ETERNITY FOREVER".
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Speaking of which -- this is the

<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
</b>	          Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The
	          legendary unproduced script that
	          was too good ever to get made?  I'd
	          kill for that part.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          I was hoping you'd say that.
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly, Simone appears to talk on her own.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	          I'll do anything to please you, Mr.

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

	          I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

<b>	
</b>	On a side monitor, we discover a highlighted box marked "PRE
	RECORD" -- Viktor's finger on the "PLAY" button.  He is
	unable to resist speaking another line.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
</b>	          And I will never, ever leave you.
<b>	
</b>	Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing him a kiss --
	until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked,
<b>	"GESTURES OF AFFECTION -- WINK, SMILE, GIGGLE, SIGH, KISS,
</b><b>	FLUTTER OF EYES, FLICK OF HAIR, PUFF OF CHEST".
</b><b>	
</b>	Viktor comes close to the monitor.  He notices something
	about Simone's face.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          You're so beautiful.  Too
	          beautiful.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor accesses a program labeled, "DISTINGUISHING FEATURES".
	He adds a "FRECKLE" and a "MOLE".
<b>	
</b>	From a distance we watch him, alone with Simone in the vast,
	empty soundstage.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR's face against the SKY.  As he walks, we reveal that
	the sky is no more than a huge, painted backdrop on the
	studio lot -- behind a parking lot.  Viktor hands his valet
	ticket to a fawning VALET MANAGER.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VALET MANAGER
</b>	          -- Just be a minute, Mr. Taransky.

	          now.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor joins other industry MOVERS and SHAKERS waiting for
	their cars under an umbrella.  A young TALENT AGENT
	approaches.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    TALENT AGENT
</b>	          Viktor!  Look, I'm sorry I didn't
	          call you back last year.  I was,

	          I'll try to talk her into it.

	          You will switch off all

	          Oh, I understand.
<b>	
</b>	As Viktor departs, the Concierge holds the registration card
	to the mirror.
<b>	
</b>	ENOMIS becomes SIMONE.
<b>	
</b>	The Concierge picks up his phone.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR enters the hotel suite.  We see a montage of scenes --
	Viktor revelling in his masquerade.
<b>	
</b>	A)  VIKTOR pulls down the covers of a bed and rolls around in
	    the sheets to give it a slept-in look.
<b>	
</b>	B)  VIKTOR sprays cologne in the bed.
<b>	
</b>	C)  VIKTOR tosses skimpy lingerie on the floor of the closet.
<b>	
</b>	D)  VIKTOR eats several candy bars from the mini-bar.
<b>	
</b>	E)  VIKTOR puts one of his own movies in the DVD player.
<b>	
</b>	F)  VIKTOR writes a note on the bedside pad.
<b>	
</b>	G)  In the bathroom, shower running, VIKTOR attempts to open
	    a tampon -- it shoots out of the applicator like a penny
	    rocket.
<b>	
</b>	H)  VIKTOR cuts a lock of "faux" hair from a Simone wig and
	    scatters it on the counter.
<b>	
</b>	I)  VIKTOR shakes open a bag of toiletries, the toothbrush
	    bouncing into the toilet bowl.  He retrieves it.
<b>	
</b>	J)  VIKTOR looks through the drapes of the hotel window -- a
	    jam of PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS has congregated outside the
	    rear entrance.
<b>	
</b>	K)  VIKTOR shines a lamp against a doll casting a life-size
	    shadow on the drapes.  A "walking" silhouette is visible
	    to the media on the street.
<b>	
</b>	L)  VIKTOR writes a message in lipstick on the mirror -- "I
<b>	    LOVE YOU V--".
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR is interrupted by a knock on the door.  He looks at
	his watch.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

	          Who is it?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>	              (from other side of door)
	          It's... Simone.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor smiles.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  HOTEL - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR stands at the rear entrance of the hotel with a leggy
	YOUNG WOMAN wearing a coat over her head.  A HOTEL DOORMAN
	keeps back the growing horde of REPORTERS.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor's limousine waits at the curb.  The coated woman
	starts towards the car but Viktor holds her back.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Not yet.
	              (scrutinizing the crowd)
	          Where's "Matinee"?  There they are. 
	          Okay, I think everyone's here. 
	          Now!
<b>	
</b>	Viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car,
	providing a perfect albeit restricted photo-op for the
	paparazzi.

<b>	
</b>	The car door slams shut as the pack descends.  MAX SAYER and
	MILTON are amongst the frustrated reporters.  The limo
	screeches away.  A POLICE MOTORCYCLIST prevents anyone
	following.
<b>	
</b>	The frustrated REPORTERS assess their efforts.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 1

<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  MISS ENOMIS'S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	MAX SAYER pays off the CONCIERGE.  His assistant, MILTON,
	begins to collect "evidence" of the celebrity -- dusting for
	fingerprints, etc.  Max rubs pencil into the impression on
	the bedside notepad revealing the message -- "The meaning of
	life is that it ends".
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	              (interrupting Milton's
	               work)
	          Leave me for a moment.
<b>	
</b>	Milton and the Concierge depart.
<b>	
</b>	Max is alone.  He looks around the room.
<b>	
</b>	A)  MAX enters the bathroom.  He picks up a drinking glass
	    and inspects it closely before placing it in a sealed
	    plastic bag.
<b>	
</b>	B)  MAX examines the wet soap from the shower and also places
	    it in a plastic bag.
<b>	
</b>	C)  MAX picks up the used toothbrush, puts it to his lips
	    before placing it in a plastic bag.
<b>	
</b>	D)  MAX gently places his hands on the toilet seat.
<b>	
</b>	E)  MAX enters the bedroom.  He carefully removes a slip from
	    a pillow.  He folds it meticulously, appearing to breathe
	    in its scent as he places it in a plastic bag.
<b>	
</b>	F)  Finally, MAX kneels and gazes at "Simone's" unmade bed. 
	    He slowly slides into the bed and slips beneath the same
	    sheets recently vacated by Viktor.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  HALLWAY - OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	MILTON, ear pressed against the door, tries to listen inside.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR TARANSKY'S LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR and the COATED WOMAN have finally left the PAPARAZZI
	in their wake.  Viktor gently removes the coat from over her
	head.
<b>	
</b>	Although the woman is impossible beautiful, she is not
	Simone.  FAITH is Simone's latest stand-in and decoy.  Viktor
	and Faith are still pressed together against one side of the
	limousine.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (not quite able to avert

	          Thank God for you, Faith.  I know
	          this is above and beyond the call
	          of duty for a stand-in.  You don't
	          know what a service you're

<b>	
</b><b>	                    FAITH
</b>	          No, thank God for you, Mr.

<b>	
</b>	Neither Viktor nor Faith seem inclined to move from their
	intimate position.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR'S HEAD hits the sofa in his living room, closely
	followed by FAITH on top of him.
<b>	
</b>	Faith tears at his clothes and her own, ravenous.  Viktor
	hardly resists.  In the midst of the wild caresses, Faith
	murmurs in his ear.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    FAITH
</b>	          Do whatever you do to Simone.

</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          What I do to Simone?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    FAITH
</b>	          Yes, call me Simone.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

<b>	
</b><b>	                    FAITH
</b>	              (still tearing at his
	               clothes)
	          Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what
	          you do to Simone.  I want to know
	          what it's like to be her just for
	          one night.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

</b><b>	                    FAITH
</b>	              (panting)
	          Is that a problem?
<b>	
</b>	As Viktor ponders the question, Faith begins to do Simone's
	deathbed speech from "Sunrise, Sunset".
<b>	
</b><b>	                    FAITH
</b>	          "Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here".
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

	               Viktor)
	          Please put your clothes on

</b>	Viktor gets up from the sofa, leaving the frustrated Faith to
	straighten her clothes.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  FUTURISTIC LANDSCAPE - "ETERNITY FOREVER" - DAY

<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR watches the rough cut of "ETERNITY FOREVER" with
	ELAINE and daughter, LAINEY.  As usual, they are mesmerized
	by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE.  The scene ends.  The
	light go up.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood
	          Foreign Press is going to eat this
	          up.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Thank you.
	              (turning to his daughter)
	          What did you think, Lainey?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          One thing bothered me.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          No, not that.  I was just wondering
	          -- in the bedroom scene in reel two
	          why did Simone have no reflection
	          when she walked in front of that
	          mirror?
<b>	
</b>	Viktor is shocked, busted.  He covers it with a laugh.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (ashen-faced)
	          I wondered if you'd spot that. 
	          You've got a good eye, Lainey.  I'm
	          proud of you.
<b>	
</b>	Elaine looks at Viktor for an explanation.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          I got them to remove the
	          reflection.  The mirror's metaphor 
	          -- to show how her character's
	          inwardly dead.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          That's genius, Viktor.  Was that
	          Simone's idea?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (sarcastic, annoyed at the
	               suggestion)
	          Who else?  It's always Simone's
	          idea.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	              (not quite convinced)
	          So that accounts for the lack of a
	          shadow in reel six?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Precisely.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR escorts ELAINE and LAINEY to Elaine's car parked
	outside the theater.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	              (as she gets into the car)
	          Good-night, Daddy.

	          Night, Lainey.
<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (drawing Elaine aside)
	          Elaine, I don't know if it's a good
	          idea for Lainey to come to the
	          screenings -- mature content and
	          all that.
<b>	
</b>	Both look to Lainey.  From inside the car Lainey watches her
	parents.

	          Maybe you're right.

	          Twelve years after your daughter's

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          You really think so?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          Yes.  To be honest I never quite
	          saw this film before -- maybe it's
	          the way Simone is playing it -- but
	          what it's saying about the illusion
	          of permanence in everyday life, how
	          that's the only way we can love --
	          I think it's really going to mean
	          something.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you
	          liked it.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          I'd love to tell her myself.

	shutter from a nearby bush.

</b><b>	EXT.  PREMIERE PARTY - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	A packed, glitzy party.  VIKTOR enters without an escort. 
	Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely
	alone.
<b>	
</b>	He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KENT,
	schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MOVER/SHAKER

</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          Thank you.  I mean, it was a team
	          effort --
<b>	
</b>	Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small
	pocket camera.  Elaine is unaware of the shot.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor picks up a drink from the bar.  A DRUNK WOMAN, perched
	unsteadily on a nearby barstool, is knocking back Jack
	Daniels.  She accidentally brushes one of her discarded
	glasses off the bar.  Viktor catches it.
<b>	
</b>	A HAND taps Viktor on the shoulder.  HAL stands there
	accompanied by his "Eternity Forever" co-star, MAC.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HAL

</b>	Far across the party, a WOMAN, with a Simone-type hairstyle,
	her back to us, is standing at the edge of a fountain.

</b>	Casually tacked up on the monitor is the MILLION DOLLAR CHECK

<b>	
</b>	VIKTOR, face and body scanned by the computer, is making a
	final test of his equipment.  When he touches his hair, bats
	his eyes, moves his hands -- so does Simone.
<b>	
</b>	VIKTOR frantically tests several different backgrounds behind
	SIMONE from a library of images.  Rainforest.  Desert.  Ritzy
	hotel suite.  Moonscape.  Factory.

</b>	          Well, no one could accuse you of
	          being over-exposed, Simone.  Why
	          have you stayed so completely out
	          of the limelight?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	              (shrugs)
	          I just think actors talk too much. 
	          Does the world really want to hear
	          your life story just because you've
	          got a movie opening Friday?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    FRANK BRAND
</b>	          Of course, the only problem with
	          shying away from publicity these
	          days is that it tends to attract
	          more.
<b>	
</b>	VIKTOR is in his element, his effeminate gestures
	frighteningly convincing.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	              (from TV)
	          Don't I know it.  That's the only
	          reason I'm here now -- to put the
	          attention back where it belongs, on
	          Mr. Taransky's film.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    FRANK BRAND
</b>	          You don't secretly want the

<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	          I'm not even sure I deserve it. 
	          After tonight I'll have almost as
	          much screen time on your show as I
	          do in my movies.  How is that

</b>	              (from TV)
	          Because, you have to understand,
	          Frank, these interviews -- none of
	          this is real.  Who I am on screen
	          and who I really am are two totally

</b>	          Thank... YOU, FRANK.
<b>	
</b>	In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug.  The feed goes
	blank on Frank Brand's screen.
<b>	
</b>	VIKTOR slumps over his computer in exhaustion.  Since SIMONE
	is still synced to his movements, the partially de-pixelated
	Simone also slumps.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor's cell phone rings.  Viktor picks up.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR / SIMONE
</b>	          Hel--
<b>	
</b>	He remembers at the last second to switch off his voice
	synthesizer.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (into phone)
	          Hello.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	We cut between the two sides of the conversation -- ELAINE on
	the phone, KENT still watching post-interview analysis on the
<b>	TV.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          -- Viktor, are you with her?  Is
	          she there?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          No.
<b>	
</b>	An anxious beat.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          Are you and Simone...
	              (blurting it out)
	          ... getting married?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (taken aback by the
	               suggestion)
	          No, of course not!
	              (realizing the
	               significance of the
	               question)
	          Why?  Would you care if we were?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	              (covering, realizing she
	               has given herself away)
	          Well, yes.  From a studio point of
	          view, it would be better if Simone
	          stayed single.
	              (quick change of topic)
	          Anyhow, I thought she came across
	          great tonight.  Intelligent, well
	          informed, a natural.  And touching. 
	          She was spectacular.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Thank you.
<b>	
</b>	A pause.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          Viktor, do you realize you always
	          do that?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Do what?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          Whenever I compliment Simone, you
	          take the credit.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          I do?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          Yes, you do...
	              (shrug)
	          Anyway, tonight was a good start.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Excuse me?  Start?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          It's a crowded summer.  We need
	          every photo-opp, sound-byte and
	          column inch we can get.  Good
	          night, Viktor.
<b>	
</b>	Elaine hangs up.  Lainey approaches.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	              (carefully broaching the
	               subject)
	          Mom, do you miss Dad?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	              (she thinks)
	          Sometimes.  But, just when I think
	          your father's changing for the
	          better, I realize he's as self
	          absorbed as ever.  He took the
	          credit for Simone tonight.
<b>	
</b>	Lainey, coming to her father's defense, glancing at the
	Nietzsche book in her hand.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          I think Dad deserves more credit
	          than he gets.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR watches SIMONE on screen.  He is unusually anxious.
<b>	
</b>	As usual SIMONE is wearing a skimpy, provocative outfit as
	she awaits instructions on the screen.  For some reason
	Viktor becomes irritated by the image.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (to Simone)
	          Will you cover yourself up!?
<b>	
</b>	He hits a button.  A thick WOOL COAT clicks over her body.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  NEW MEXICO DESERT - MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	The ECHO newscar streaks through the bronze and purple
	desert.  MAX and his assistant MILTON emerge from the car.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          -- I've been here before! -- On my
	          honeymoon with my ex-wife.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MILTON
</b>	          Is that why she left you?
<b>	
</b>	Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND
	interview.  He compares her desert location to the one in
	front of him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	              (pointing out a Joshua
	               tree)
	          You see, that's the exact same tree
	          and in the distance, there's the...
	              (voice trailing away)
	          ... mountain.
<b>	
</b>	Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is
	now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn.
<b>	
</b>	Max and Milton are mystified -- they look back at the photo.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MILTON
</b>	          It's a hotel.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          I don't understand.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MILTON
</b>	          Could they have built that hotel
	          since yesterday?
<b>	
</b>	Max shakes his head, deeply concerned.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          Get in the car.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR has transformed his soundstage into a one-man
	publicity machine.  The floor is littered with photographs of
	SIMONE in various states of dress and undress.
<b>	
</b>	Using a sophisticated Photoshop computer program, VIKTOR
	constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine
	spreads -- "Time", "People", "Us", "Life", "Popular
	Mechanics".
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (angrily into phone)
	          -- We don't do the photo shoot, you
	          don't get the cover... written
	          answers to written questions,
	          that's right... website interviews,
	          no problem.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor calls up a "DANCE OPTION".  Choosing from a HULA
	DANCER, a BELLY DANCER and a CLASSICAL BALLERINA, he removes
	Simone's head and places it on the body of the ballerina. 
	She begins to dance for him.
<b>	
</b>	He uses a program to construct childhood photographs of
	SIMONE and other childhood memorabilia.
<b>	
</b>	He employs backgrounds from numerous on-line library sources.
	With a quick cut and paste he is able to place Simone on a
	beach in San Tropez or a bicycle factory in Calcutta.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (muttering to himself)
	          You want exposure, Elaine?  I'll
	          give you over-exposure...
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  ELAINE'S OFFICE - STUDIO - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	ELAINE watches TV in her office.  She cannot change channels
	without finding Simone sitting in a chair giving generic
	answers.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON ELAINE'S TV)
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	          I think "Eternity Forever" is my
	          finest work.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	          I'm most proud of my work in
	          "Eternity Forever".
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	          I think people are going to love
	          "Eternity Forever".
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR inspects a cut-out photograph of Simone in "ETERNITY
	FOREVER" costume.  He speaks to the photo.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Forgive me, Simone.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  FASTFOOD RESTAURANT - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The photograph of Simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink
	cup -- a pyramid of cups promoting "ETERNITY FOREVER" Happy
	Meals.  Beneath the plastic pyramid is a SIMONE action figure
	in a convertible.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b><b>	         "ETERNITY FOREVER" HAS BIG FUTURE AT B.O.!

</b><b>	
</b>	Shouts the "Hollywood Reporter".
<b>	
</b>	The trade papers sit on the coffee table in front of VIKTOR
	who reclines on a leather sofa, watching TV, gazing lovingly
	at Simone.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S TV)
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	          Of course, being a movie star is
	          wonderful, but I have so many other
	          ways I want to express myself --
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  BOOKSTORE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Various book titles are on display:
<b>	
</b><b>	            "SIMONE'S FAVORITE SOUTHERN RECIPES"
</b><b>	
</b>	            "HUMAN:KIND - The POETRY of SIMONE"

</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A banner in a window reads.  "In Stock: SIMONE'S EASY-WEAR
	FASHION".  Mannequins model the clothes.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	We focus on the screen where VIKTOR types in instructions:
<b>	
</b><b>	  SEARCH: "NUMBER 1 HITS - FEMALE ARTISTS/BILLBOARD CHARTS"
</b><b>	
</b><b>	  PERIOD: "LAST 40 YEARS"
</b><b>	
</b>	A list of the Number 1 hits for the last forty years promptly
	appears on the screen along with photographs of the
	artists --
<b>	
</b><b>	PATSY CLINE, ELLA FITZGERALD, ARETHA FRANKLIN, JANICE JOPLIN,
</b>	CAROL KING, WHITNEY HOUSTON, MADONNA, etc.  Beneath the title
	of each song is a graphic representation of the music --
	"PITCH" and "RESONANCE".
<b>	
</b>	Viktor presses a button: "MORPH".  The audio waves converge.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR, wearing headphones, records his composite pop song. 
	As usual when he sings into his microphone, Simone also
	sings.  The catchy song is titled: "(If You Can't Believe In
	Yourself) Believe In Me".
<b>	
</b><b>	SIMONE APPEARS IN A MUSIC VIDEO.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT.  RECORD STORE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The video for SIMONE's song plays on the video wall inside
	the record store.  TEENAGE GIRLS, buying CD's, dance
	adoringly in front of the screen, unaware that they are
	gyrating to the vocals of a middle-aged man.
<b>	
</b>	INSERT - "(If You Can't Believe In Yourself) Believe In Me"
	shoots up the Billboard charts.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	CLOSE UP on the name "SIMONE" painted on the stern of a
	luxury yacht.
<b>	
</b>	VIKTOR is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last
	a moment to savor his success.  Simone's hit single plays on
	the yacht's stereo.  He looks at peace.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  MARINA - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A TOURIST has his arm around SIMONE, having his photograph
	taken.  However, we discover that the Simone is only a
	lifesize cardboard cutout used by a STREET VENDOR to sell
	snapshots.  He also has cardboard cutouts of the POPE and
<b>	ELVIS.
</b><b>	
</b>	MAX SAYER and MILTON walk by.
<b>	
</b>	Tying up his boat, VIKTOR's mood is abruptly shattered by the
	sight of Max and Milton walking down the pier towards him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          Nice boat, Taransky.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          It's a yacht.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          I know what you're up to.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (pushing past Max)
	          I don't have time for this, Sayer.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          I think you do.
	              (holding up his video
	               print of Simone in the
	               desert)
	          I know it's a fake.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor freezes.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          Got your attention now?
<b>	
</b>	Max compares the shot to one of the current desert location
	with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	              (referring to the
	               photographs)
	          It's bogus.  You used an old
	          library shot for the background.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (ashen)
	          The background is.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          She was never in New Mexico.  She
	          never left the studio.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of faking
	the background.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	              (referring to a large
	               bundle of other shots
	               under his arm)
	          I've done my homework.  I've
	          studied her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          -- I bet you have.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          -- I've looked at every piece of
	          publicity she's ever done, the
	          video in the supermarket, there's
	          no evidence she's ever left the
	          studio.
	              (afterthought)
	          Oh, and for some reason this woman
	          leaves no paper trail.  But I have
	          "obtained" a copy of your bank
	          accounts.  I know you have power of
	          attorney but so far you haven't
	          transferred one single solitary
	          cent to her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          I'm keeping it in trust.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          I know that's what you'd like us to
	          believe.  But I got to tell you --
	          embezzlement is a serious matter. 
	          Not to mention abduction.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Abduction?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          I don't buy the whole recluse scam. 
	          How are you doing it?  What is it --
	          drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? 
	          All three?  What do you do -- keep
	          her locked in a box somewhere?
<b>	
</b>	Viktor flinches at the remark.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          I want to see her.  Unless you show
	          me Simone live and in person I show
	          these pictures to the authorities.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor pauses, considering the threat.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX
</b>	          Er,... good.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MILTON
</b>	          That's good.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor walks away leaving Max confused.
<b>	
</b>	The breeze whips the photos of SIMONE out of Max's hands and
	into the sea.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  CONCERT STADIUM - DUSK
</b><b>	
</b>	A vast, empty stadium.  On the stage, a lone microphone. 
	VIKTOR approaches, gazing out at the vast arena.  Several

<b>	
</b><b>	                    PROMOTER

</b><b>	
</b>	A spotlight falls on the solitary figure of Simone, standing
	alone on the stage with a guitar over her shoulder (the only
	accompaniment) -- dwarfed by the huge stage.  However, on
	closer inspection, the spotlight is actually a laser beam
	creating a hologram.  Clouds of smoke and strobe lighting aid
	the illusion.
<b>	
</b>	The only clear view of Simone for the audience is provided by
	the enormous video screens on either side of the stage.  The
	CROWD stares up at the jumbotrons, blissfully unaware that

</b>	VIKTOR's face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied
	crowd gazing up at the jumbotron -- singing along, many in
	tears, overcome with emotion -- holding cigarette lighters
	aloft.  For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry --
	the grand illusionist.  Viktor is at the height of his

<b>	
</b>	As he returns to the trailer, Viktor catches sight of his
	lipstick-smeared mouth in the mirror on the inside of the
	trailer door.  He slams the side of the trailer in
	frustration.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - NIGHT

	the screen.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE

</b>	          Obviously, this can't last.  She's
	          going to dump him.  Viktor won't be
	          able to take that.  He's too
	          sensitive.  It'll destroy him.

<b>	
</b><b>	                    KENT

</b><b>	EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - BEACH - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR, deep in thought, stands at the water's edge, staring
	at the breaking waves.  LAINEY joins him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Hey, Lainey.
	              (gently teasing her)

<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          I noticed.

<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          Dad, you know I don't like to get
	          between you and mom but she's

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (buoyed by the news)
	          Really?  Too bad.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Lainey, you know Simone and I don't

<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if
	          it came from Simone, if Simone
	          spoke to Mom -- she could

	              (shrug)
	          Dinner, maybe.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A
	          phone call?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          Too impersonal.  They have to meet

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          I'll see what I can do.
	              (a thought occurs)
	          You know, Lainey.  I don't believe
	          you've ever once asked to meet
	          Simone.  Don't you like her?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          I love her but that doesn't mean I
	          need to meet her.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor is confused.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          Why?  So I can tell my friends at
	          school -- as if that validates my
	          life somehow.  What's Simone going
	          to say to a fourteen-year-old
	          anyhow?  She's going to be polite
	          because you're my father but we're
	          not suddenly going to become
	          friends -- we have nothing in
	          common.  It's not going to be real. 
	          Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in
	          my head every day.  Why kill the
	          dream?  What do they say, "don't
	          get too close to your idols, they
	          always disappoint you".
<b>	
</b>	Viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter, so much wiser than
	her years.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          I love you, Lainey.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          I love you too, daddy.
<b>	
</b>	A car horn sounds outside the house.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          That's Mom.
	              (kissing him on the
	               forehead)

<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	          Right beside you.  I borrowed
	          Viktor's car.
<b>	
</b>	Elaine looks to the inside lane.  SIMONE, wearing sunglasses,
	phone to her ear, drives alongside.  Simone waves, somewhat
	mechanically.  Elaine waves back.  They keep driving as they
	talk.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The sunglasses-clad SIMONE is a mannequin, seated in the
	driver's seat with her left hand on the phone obscuring her
	mouth, right hand attached to the steering wheel.
<b>	
</b>	Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side, VIKTOR drives the
	car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering
	with one hand, occasionally sneaking a glance to the road
	ahead.  He speaks on a phone through the Simone synthesizer.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
</b>	          I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm

</b>	          I can't imagine how you ever let a

<b>

	the Simone mannequin.

<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY

</b>	Simone stares back at him blankly.
<b>	
</b>	A copy of VARIETY is slid under the soundstage door.  The

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

<b>	
</b><b>	                    MAX

<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR escorts LAINEY, blindfolded, around the corner of his

	of-view we see the sportscar Simone drove in "ETERNITY

</b><b>	                    NICOLA
</b>	          Do you want me to do it again?
<b>	
</b>	Viktor does not reply.  Nicola quietly leaves.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large
	photograph of SIMONE giving her acceptance speech via
	satellite.  However, ELAINE is gazing at a small inset
	picture of VIKTOR, HERSELF and LAINEY arriving at the Oscar
	Ceremony.
<b>	
</b>	Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  SWIMMING POOL - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S SCREEN)
</b><b>	
</b>	Old home video of ELAINE.  She is in a garden by a swimming
	pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera. 
	Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera
	operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a
	kiss to the camera.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	While the ever-seductive SIMONE waits patiently on-screen for
	Viktor's instructions, VIKTOR is gazing at the smaller
	monitor -- the home video of ELAINE.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor freezes the tape.  Elaine appears particularly
	beautiful.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor electronically cuts out Elaine's mannerism and morphs
	it into Simone.  Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same
	dazzling smile.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	At her desk, JANE is busy trying to mimic Simone's hairstyle
	as she talks on the phone.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JANE
</b>	              (into phone)
	          -- Oh sure, she comes in all the

<b>	
</b>	Jane hurriedly hangs up.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JANE

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

	          I'm leaving early tonight.  If you
	          need me I'll be at the beach house
	          having dinner with a... certain
	          someone.
<b>	
</b>	Jane tries to conceal her interest.  As soon as Viktor exits
	the office, JANE picks up the phone.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JANE
</b>	              (into phone, under her
	               breath)
	          ... Elaine Christian please.
<b>	
</b>	We reveal VIKTOR, outside the door, eavesdropping on his
	assistant, pleased she has taken the bait.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR dims the lights, plays "mood" music.  The doorbell
	rings.
<b>	
</b>	He checks himself in the mirror.  In the reflection, he spies
	an autographed photo of HIMSELF with his arm around SIMONE. 
	He hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door.
<b>	
</b>	ELAINE stands there.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          Viktor, I'm picking up Lainey.
<b>	
</b>	Elaine is over-dressed for her supposed errand.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

</b>	              (feigning absent

	          Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. 
	          How embarrassing.  I don't know
	          what I was thinking.  With all the
	          excitement lately...
	              (peering past him)

</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

	          As a matter-of-fact I am.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE

</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          I suppose I could stay, just until
	          she arrives.
<b>	
</b>	Elaine takes a seat on the sofa.  Viktor hands her a glass of
	wine and sits beside her -- close.
<b>	
</b>	They both knock back their wine in one long gulp, both
	apparently in need of courage.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE

</b>	          I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. 
	          She's lucky to have you, Viktor.

	          Is she really having your baby?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	              (instantly regretting the

	          I just read somewhere --

	          I should be going, she'll be here

</b>	Viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          -- She already is.  Simone's not

</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          That's sweet, Viktor, but I

	              (meeting his gaze)
	          It's strange.  I've stabbed people
	          in the back, clawed and slept my
	          way to where I am -- it goes with
	          the territory -- but, for some
	          reason, I can't betray Simone. 
	          There's... I don't know any other

	          to her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          No, there isn't.  There's nothing

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          Oh, Viktor.  You say that now --
	          because we're here, alone, like
	          this.  But in the morning, you'd go
	          back to her.  What man wouldn't?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          No, I will end my relationship with
	          her -- totally.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          But you don't understand.  She'll
	          always be there -- at some party,
	          on some magazine cover, some song
	          on the radio, up on some screen.

</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (desperate)
	          No.  She'll never work again --
	          retire, never make a movie or a
	          record, or appear ever again.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	              (confused)
	          Of course she will.  Her public
	          will demand it.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          Not if I don't let her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          You?
<b>	
</b>	Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          I'm going to tell you a secret now,
	          Elaine.
	              (mustering all his nerve)
	          Simone is not a real person.  I
	          invented her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	              (misinterpreting his
	               remark)
	          Every actor is an invention,
	          Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. 
	          No one's denying that you
	          discovered Simone.  But it's like
	          finding a diamond in the desert. 
	          Anyone can trip over it, but it's
	          not the finder who sparkles.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (agitated)
	          -- No, no, I didn't trip over her. 
	          You don't understand --
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	              (ignoring him)
	          -- You just got lucky that she's
	          loyal enough to stay with you. 
	          Maybe she's staying out of pity,
	          who knows?  She certainly doesn't
	          need you.  Some people even say
	          you're holding her back.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (wounded)
	          Who says that -- ?
	              (shaking off the insult)
	          -- Never mind.  You have to listen
	          to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air,
	          pixels, molded by me from a

	          it from a madman -- I can show
	          you --
<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          -- She's a figment of my own
	          imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky,
	          have perpetrated the greatest hoax,

	          sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of-
	          sleight in entertainment history!
	          And still no one appreciates me,

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	              (rolling her eyes)
	          You're drunker than I thought.  Are

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          No!  Whatever talent Simone has
	          comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear,
	          as God is my judge.  You don't know
	          what I've been through.  Tens of
	          thousands of mind-numbing hours in
	          front of that screen, nights
	          without end, and look what it's
	          cost me.
	              (producing his spectacles)
	          Why do you think I've been wearing
	          these?  I may have done irreparable
	          harm to my eyesight, and why?  To
	          extract and refine the infinite
	          nuances of a human being -- a human
	          soul.
	              (a final explanation)
	          Don't you see?  I made Simone!
<b>	
</b>	A pause.  His words hang in the air.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	          You made Simone?
	              (a trace of pity)
	          Viktor, she made you.
<b>	
</b>	Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Viktor
	alone in his house.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A hung-over VIKTOR enters his office.  Suddenly, he stops and
	confronts the standee of SIMONE.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          You bitch!  I'll destroy you!
<b>	
</b>	JANE stares in shock.  She discreetly exits.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, smiling venomously at
	SIMONE.  He begins to digitally disrobe Simone.
<b>	
</b><b>	MONTAGE:
</b><b>	
</b>	A)  Peering through a gap in the drapes of his Malibu house,
	    VIKTOR watches MAX dig through his trash.  Max finds a
	    beat up reel of 16mm film.
<b>	
</b>	    MAX holds the end up to the light -- his eyes pop.
<b>	
</b>	B)  The ECHO headline screams, "SIMONE'S HARD CORE PAST" and
	    shows censored film frames of a naked Simone in a
	    compromising position.
<b>	
</b>	    VIKTOR, hovering at a supermarket check-out line,
	    overhears two WOMEN discussing the article.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    WOMAN 1
</b>	          Disgusting...
<b>	
</b><b>	                    WOMAN 2
</b>	              (sympathetic)
	          She must have been so desperate to
	          do something like that, so
	          depraved.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    WOMAN 1
</b>	          I'm still naming my baby after her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    WOMAN 2
</b>	          You're having a boy.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    WOMAN 1
</b>	          So?
<b>	
</b>	    Viktor blanches.  It is not the reaction he'd hoped for.
<b>	
</b>	C)  Inside a theater, VIKTOR hovers by the door, smirking.
<b>	
</b>	    ON SCREEN, we hear a farmyard scene -- SIMONE in an empty
	    farmyard on all fours, grunting like a pig, and foraging
	    for muddy vegetables.
<b>	
</b>	    The AUDIENCE is shocked, then suddenly breaks into
	    spontaneous applause.
<b>	
</b>	    Viktor, enraged, exits into the lobby past the poster for
	    "I AM PIG - Starring Simone".
<b>	
</b>	D)  A pretentious FILM CRITIC talks to camera, a film poster
	    behind him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    FILM CRITIC
</b>	          For Simone to do something as brave
	          as "I AM PIG" at this point in her
	          career, with so much to lose -- all
	          I can say is, "I Am Pig, I Am
	          Oscar".
<b>	
</b>	E)  In his soundstage, VIKTOR moves a slider that adds
	    wrinkles to Simone.
<b>	
</b>	F)  SIMONE appears on a morning talk show -- as usual, remote
	    on a TV screen.  However, her squeaky-clean image has
	    gone -- hair unkempt, bloated, chain-smoking and drinking
	    during the interview.  The HOSTS are smiling weakly.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HOST
</b>	          Simone, that's a rather
	          controversial position.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	          I just think all elementary schools
	          should have a firing range -- so
	          students can learn how to defend
	          themselves.  We could fit it
	          inbetween recess and American
	          History.
<b>	
</b>	Another clip:
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	          If there's a hole in the ozone
	          layer why can't I see it?
<b>	
</b>	Another clip:
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	          Immigration?!  God, isn't it
	          crowded enough?!
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HOSTS
</b>	          Just as we always knew.  Simone's
	          not like other celebrities.  She
	          speaks her mind!
<b>	
</b>	G)  VIKTOR driving along a city street, suddenly slams on his
	    brakes, almost causing an accident.  He stares numbly up
	    at a twenty-foot high smiling photo of Simone on a
	    billboard featuring a huge cover of TIME MAGAZINE.  It
	    reads, "SIMONE: WOMAN OF THE YEAR".
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (to himself)
	          She's trying to kill me.
<b>	
</b>	Realizing what he's said, a thought comes into his eyes.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	An inscription on a headstone reads:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         HANK ALENO
</b>	                Remembered Virtually Forever
<b>	
</b>	VIKTOR kneels at HANK's grave.  He places a bunch of flowers
	there.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	              (referring to the flowers)
	          They're plastic, Hank.  I know
	          that's the way you'd want it.
	              (glancing to a Simone
	               billboard outside the
	               cemetery wall)
	          She killed you, Hank.  Now she's
	          killing me.  She's a serial killer.
	              (ducking out of sight of
	               the billboard as if
	               Simone is watching him)
	          But I don't know how to stop her. 
	          She's taken on a life of her own. 
	          I can't just come clean -- make
	          some confession.  I've defrauded
	          millions -- they'd turn on me.  And
	          I can't put the genie back in the
	          bottle.  If she stopped working --
	          dropped out of sight, they'd never
	          let it rest.  I've tried to kill
	          her career but they like her even
	          more.
	              (more desperate)
	          What am I going to do, Hank?
<b>	
</b>	A thought occurs to Viktor.  He slowly rises from behind
	Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

<b>	
</b>	He speaks into the voice synthesizer, Simone's face
	automatically speaking the words he speaks -- the final time

<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          It's the only way, Simone.  If it's

	          live on in the public's heart like
	          all the other tragic figures that
	          went before their time.  There's no
	          love like posthumous love.
<b>	
</b>	On the screen, Simone is on the verge of tears.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          I know what you're thinking.  It's
	          a phoney-baloney world.  The women
	          are surgically enhanced, the
	          athletes are on steroids, the
	          singers are lip-syncing if they're
	          even singing at all, the news is
	          entertainment, the politicians are
	          bought and paid for -- we're living
	          one big lie.  So why shouldn't you
	          live too?  You're more authentic
	          than the people who adore you.
	              (a trace of despair)
	          And that's the problem.  You're
	          looking at the real fraud.  I told
	          myself this was all about the work
	          but if that was the truth, it
	          wouldn't matter to me -- and it
	          does.  It wasn't that the artists
	          had no respect for the art.  They
	          had no respect for me.  Someone
	          like you, you have so much love
	          showered on you -- I just wanted to
	          feel one tiny drop on my face.  I'm
	          sorry, Simone.  Here I've been
	          trying to convince the world that
	          you exist, but I was really trying
	          to convince them that I exist. 
	          It's not that you aren't human,
	          Simone, it's that I am.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked, "PLAGUE - Ver.
	8.1".  He places the disc in the machine.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor sees that Simone is crying.  He touches a tear on his
	own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor hesitates -- a moment of doubt -- then presses
	"ENTER".  The image of SIMONE's face gradually begins to
	deconstruct -- pixel by pixel -- as the virus takes hold. 
	The pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen
	like dust.  Finally, the dust is blown away in a single
	digital breath.
<b>	
</b>	For a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on
	his own desk.
<b>	
</b>	Viktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen. 
	His hard-drive now corrupted, he picks up his original disc
	marked, "SIMULATION ONE".
<b>	
</b>	He tosses this disc into a steamer trunk he has loaded with
	hundreds of discs relating to Simone's software.  He shuts
	the lid and begins dragging the trunk towards the door.

</b>	          I know it's embarrassing to admit
	          it, mom, but when I think about it 
	          -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it
	          feels like I have.  I know more
	          about her than members of my own
	          family.  She's even in my dreams. 
	          But I realized, going back through
	          my diary, they were all TV
	          appearances, near misses at
	          parties, second-hand rumor, gossip
	          on the internet.  I've never
	          actually seen Simone up close,
	          touched her, been in her physical
	          presence.  Have you?

</b><b>	                    ELAINE

	          Well, I --
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          -- We don't believe daddy because
	          we don't want to believe we were

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ELAINE
</b>	              (trying to shake the

	          Lainey, there's no evidence that
	          Simone isn't real.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	          Listen to what you're saying, mom. 
	          Is there any evidence she is?
<b>	
</b>	Lainey finally tries another file.  She presses "EJECT".  The
	"PLAGUE" disc spits out of the machine.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LAINEY
</b>	              (regarding the disc)
	          There's one part of dad's story
	          that may have been true.  Simone
	          may have contracted a virus.
<b>

	          ... Listen, I've found a
	          psychiatrist in Ventura -- well
	          respected -- who's willing to
	          testify under oath that you have
	          diminished capacity due to the
	          trauma of your divorce, ten years
	          of abject failure in the movie

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR
</b>	          -- No!  I can't go along with this

<b>	
</b><b>	                    VIKTOR

<b>	
</b>	The Lawyer spins around guiltily.  The Detective stands
	outside the cell, clearly overhearing the confession. 
	Viktor, resigned to his fate, couldn't care less.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    DETECTIVE

<b>	
</b>	The reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself -- SIMONE,
	on the studio lot, looking more beautiful than ever.  She
	winks to the camera.
<b>

	both.
<b>

</b>	VIKTOR sits beside ELAINE.  LAINEY sits opposite, studying

</b><b>	                    ELAINE

<b>	
</b>	Once again his daughter's words have a ghastly ring of truth. 
	Viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually
	forces its way through the reporters.
<b>	
</b>	He recognizes MAX and MILTON amongst the mob.  Max has
	hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the

</b>	          With everything that was going on

	          out of sight for a while -- I

<b>	
</b><b>	                    FRANK BRAND
</b>	          We all do.

</b><b>	                    SIMONE

</b><b>	                    FRANK BRAND

</b>	SIMONE holds up a beautiful BABY BOY to camera.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMONE
</b>	          I suppose this little man had

	          Aren't you, Viktor?
<b>	
</b>	On Frank Brand's monitor, the camera pulls back to reveal
	VIKTOR, sitting on a sofa -- an idyllic domestic scene.
