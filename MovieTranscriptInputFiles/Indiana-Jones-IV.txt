                   a.k.a. Indiana Jones and the Garden of Life


                               A Screenplay by 
                               Chris Columbus


<b>                                                                        FIRST DRAFT
</b><b>                                                                        2/10/95
</b>






        UNDERWATER - CLOSE-UP: A brightly colored FLY, attached to a dangling,
        fishing line. A large SALMON swims to the fly. The salmon EXAMINES the
        fly, deciding whether or not to bite.

        CAMERA PANS UPWARD, tracking the line and moving OUT OF THE WATER. We
        PASS the crooked boards of a small ROWBOAT and continue to PAN UPWARD.
        A MAN reclines in the boat. NAPPING. His hands gently grip a WOODEN
        FISHING POLE. He is handsomely dressed in SPORTSMAN'S trousers and a
        blazer. His green, tweed fishing hat is lowered OVER HIS FACE. Its
        brim is filled with various types of TACKLE and BAIT.

        It is DUSK. A warm, SUMMER evening. The boat rests on a calm lake,
        surrounded by MOORS. Thick night FOG has begun to settle over the
        entire area.

<b>        TITLE: SCOTLAND. 1937.
</b>
        Suddenly, the man's fishing line becomes TAUT. The wooden pole
        BUCKLES. The man STIRS. He SITS UP, moving the hat from his face.
        CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, into a CLOSE UP of the man. It is INDIANA
        JONES. His face ANXIOUS... HOPEFUL... Indy begins to REEL in his
        catch.

        A VOICE interrupts. In the DISTANCE.

<b>                                        MACGOWAN (O.S.)
</b>                        Doctor Jones!... Doctor Jones !...

        Indy TURNS to the direction of the sound, still STRUGGLING with the
        line.

<b>        INDIANA'S POV
</b>
        Countless ORANGE FLAMES sparkle across the moors. The TORCHES are
        being carried by several members of a small village. The VILLAGERS are
        gathered behind a group of SIX POLICEMEN. The policemen are headed by
        INSPECTOR ANGUS MACGOWAN, a plump, balding fellow, with a veiny,
        bulbous nose, beady green eyes and a thick, curled red moustache.
        MacGowan SHOUTS to Indy.

<b>                                        MACGOWAN
</b>                        We need your assistance!

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                                (struggling with the
                                fishing line)
                        C'mon, Mac... It's the first bite
                        I've had all week...

<b>                                        MACGOWAN
</b>                        Please... It's very importantl...

        Indiana STRUGGLES a bit longer with the line. But his conscience
        prevails and Indy DROPS the fishing pole. With a GRUMBLE, he ROWS back
        to shore.

<b>        THE MOORS - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER
</b>
        NIGHT has fallen. It is very DARK. A RELUCTANT Indiana has joined the
        Inspector and the other Policemen. They LEAD the townspeople along the
        foggy moors. Slowly, carefully, the villagers SEARCH... CREEPING...
        their faces tense, many unable to hide their FEAR. A summer wind sends
        an eeire HOWL whistling through the night air. Blue MOONLIGHT bathes
        the moors, creating stark, frightening shadows.

        An expression of ANGER and ANNOYANCE cover Indiana's face. He GRUMBLES
        to MacGowan.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Do you value our friendship, Mac?

<b>                                        MACGOWAN
</b>                        More than me' nightly pint.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Then this better not be some wild
                        goose chase...

<b>                                        MACGOWAN
</b>                        T'ain't wild geese we're after,
                        Doctor Jones. You got me' word on
                        that...
                                (sincere)
                        ...and a MacGowan's word is truer
                        than an angel's kiss!

        There is a sudden SCREAM! One of the villagers STUMBLES UPON
        something. Everyone GATHERS around the villager.

        A CORPSE lies before them. The body has a somewhat rubbery appearance,
        as if all of its bones had been BROKEN. The man's pale, greenish face
        is FROZEN in a hideous grimace. Indiana and MacGowan STARE in shock.
        The villagers WHISPER among themselves.

<b>                                        YOUNG MAN
</b>                        Scotty Ferguson.

<b>                                        OLD WOMAN
</b>                        He's the eighth.

<b>                                        MAN
</b>                        Just like the others...all his bones
                        busted...crushed...

<b>                                        OLD MAN
</b>                        Whatever's killin' people around
                        here ain't human.

<b>                                        WOMAN
</b>                                (pointing OFFSCREEN)
                        It's there! Again!

        The woman SHOOTS FORWARD. The police and the townspeople are right
        BEHIND her. A curious Indiana FOLLOWS.

        The woman stops in a CLEARING. She is POINTING ahead. The villagers
        SURROUND her. They STARE ahead, in the direction where the woman
        points. Nearly a mile in the distance, WE SEE

<b>        AN ANCIENT SCOTTISH CASTLE.
</b>
        An enormous, 16th CENTURY stone structure. Tall, forboding towers,
        lined with menacing GARGOYLES, pierce the night sky. The castle
        appears DESERTED. Its interior is completely DARK, save for a small,
        flickering CANDLELIGHT. It burns from the castle's UPSTAIRS WINDOW.

        Indiana gives a QUESTIONING look to MacGowan. The Inpector points to
        the castle's upstairs window.

<b>                                        MACGOWAN
</b>                        That light...only burns after a
                        murder's been committed.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                                (nods, turning toward
                                the castle)
                        Let's go.

        The villagers STEP BACK. Eyes wide with FEAR. Murmers of 'Ain't goin'
        in there', 'Nor I', 'Got me a wife and kids', are heard from the
        TERRIFIED villagers. Indiana TURNS to MacGowan. Even the usually
        sturdy Inspector is TREMBLING. But MacGowan turns to his men, FORCING
        himself to be strong.

<b>                                        MACGOWAN
</b>                        Well... Ahmmmm...that is what we're
                        here for...eh, men?...ah...
                                (points to men)
                        Hennesey... Galbraith...
                        Bottomley... You're comin' with us.

        As each man is called, the color LEAVES his face. The chosen policemen
        RELUCTANTLY join the Inspector and Indiana, as they begin walking
        TOWARD the castle. The remaining villagers and policemen STAY BEHIND.
        WAITING. The elderly woman KISSES the crucifix that hangs from her
        neck. She STARES at the departing men.

<b>                                        ELDERLY WOMAN
</b>                        May God help them.

<b>                                                                        CUT TO:
</b>
<b>        THE CASTLE DOORS.
</b>
        Two enormous wooden doors, covered with intricate CARVINGS of demons,
        serpents and gargoyles, adorn the castle entrance. Indiana and the
        police STAND before the doors. Indy GLANCES to the upstairs window.
        The candle still FLICKERS.

        A long, wooden bar, carved into the shape of a SERPENT, is fastened
        through the metal door latches. It BLOCKS the castle entrance. Indy
        and the Policemen GRAB HOLD of the bar. It is extremely HEAVY. Using
        all of their strength, they manage to slide the bar OUT of the door
        latches. It hits the ground with a THUD, rolling down the castle
        stairs.

        Indiana CLUTCHES the rusty, metal door handles. He PULLS. HARD. The
        doors CREAK. GROAN. And slowly OPEN. A thick CLOUD OF DUST explodes
        from inside of the castle. It BLOWS OUT all of the torches.

        Behind the open doors, there is only TOTAL DARKNESS. Indiana ENTERS,
        holding the flashlight before him. The Policemen exchange FRIGHTENED
        glances. Inspector MacGowan SHOVES them through the open doors.

<b>        INT. CASTLE
</b>
        Indy's flashlight BEAM glazes over the castle's interior. It is a
        STONE PALACE. FILLED with elaborate, antique furnishings, macabre
        sculptures and oil paintings. The place is bathed in DUST. Thick
        COBWEBS fill each corner. It is extremely COLD. The men's breaths are
        VISIBLE. Hennesey RUBS his folded arms.

<b>                                        HENNESEY
</b>                        It's deathly cold in 'ere. How could
                        a human bein' survive?...

        Hearing this, the other Policemen exchange TERRIFIED glances. Indiana
        shines his flashlight to a TWISTING, STONE STAIRCASE. The staircase
        spirals upward along a far wall, leading to the SECOND FLOOR. A FAINT
        GLIMMER of light emanates from the top of the stairs. Indiana moves
        FORWARD. The Policemen FOLLOW.

        Indiana ASCENDS the stairs. SLOWLY. SILENTLY. Toward the LIGHT.
        MacGowan and the others are directly BEHIND Indy. As he makes his way
        to the top, Indiana examines the bizarre OIL PAINTINGS that line the
        wall. There are various PORTRAITS and LANDSCAPES, depicting everything
        from MILITARY BATTLES to SUNDAY PICNICS. But the unsettling quality of
        the pictures, is that they each feature the same white haired, ELDERLY
        MAN. Indy COMMENTS to Mac.

<b>                                        MACGOWAN
</b>                        Baron Seamus Seagrove III. Some say
                        'e walks the moors every midnight...
                        others claim e's been dead for
                        years...

        Indy arrives at the TOP OF THE STAIRS. His hand rests on a SCULPTURE
        that is part of the bannister. The sculpture is a bust of BARON
        SEAGROVE. Indiana makes his way to the first doorway, where the LIGHT
        emanates. The door is WIDE OPEN. A THICK COBWEB covers the entrance.
        Indy WIPES away the web, and ENTERS the room. The Policemen DRAW their
        pistols. They FOLLOW.

<b>        INT. ROOM
</b>
        A BEDROOM. Deserted, except for a few pieces of elaborate, ancient
        FURNITURE and a large CANOPY BED. Everything in the room is CAKED with
        dust and cobwebs...save for the burning CANDLE. It RESTS on the
        windowsill, in a sparkling, sterling silver holder. It bathes the room
        in ORANGE LIGHT.

        Indiana walks TOWARD the candle. Arm outstreched, he prepares to LIFT
        it. The Policeman WATCH. SHIVERING. SILENT. Tightly gripping their
        PISTOLS. Indy's fingers are INCHES from the candlestick. SUDDENLY...

        There is a LOUD WHOOSH! The candle GOES OUT! Indiana DROPS his
        flashlight. There is TOTAL DARKNESS. We hear the distant, MANICAL
        LAUGH of a man. It ECHOES through the castle. Indy retrieves the
        flashlight, clicking it back ON. The candle has DISAPPEARED! The laugh
        has SOBSIDED.

        MacGowan LOOKS at his men. A TROOBLED look covers the Inspector's
        face. MacGowan's eyes DART about the room. Hennesy is GONE!

<b>                                        MACGOWAN

                        'E was standin' right 'ere! Just a
                        second ago... Standin' right beside
                        me!...

        THE SOOND OF A BELL! A thick, dull RINGING! In the DISTANCE! It sends
        a CHILL through the men. Indiana DARTS out of the room. FOLLOWING the
        sound. The Policemen are right BEHIND HIM.

<b>        INT. CASTLE
</b>
        Indy and the Police HURRY down the stairs. The ringing bell CONTINUES.
        MacGowan is CALLING for Hennesey. Indy DASHES to a door along the far
        wall. He OPENS it. It leads into a DARK BASEMENT. The sound of the
        ringing bell echoes from INSIDE. Indiana ENTERS, motioning for the
        others to FOLLOW.

<b>        INT. BASEMENT
</b>
        A decrepit, narrow, wooden STAIRWAY leads into the basement. Indy
        holds tightly to his FLASHLIGHT. The Policemen are CLUSTERED behind
        him, taking each step with extreme caution. The boards CREAK and GROAN
        with their every move.

        MacGowan LEANS to his side, calling for Hennesey. MacGowan's weight
        causes the rotted bannister to SNAP IN TWO! He LOSES his footing!
        FALLING off the side of the stairs! Indiana's arm SHOOTS OUT! GRABBING
        HOLD of MacGowan's collar. Indy PULLS MacGowan back to SAFETY.
        MacGowan CATCHES his breath. SHAKING.

<b>                                        MACGOWAN
</b>                        Thanks for catchin' me.

</b>                        I'd rather be catchin' trout.

        They CONTINUE down the stairs, arrivifig at the bottom. It is a large,
        MUSTY STONE BASEMENT. The slimy walls are covered with a GREEN MOSS.
        There are several DOORS along the basement wall. The sound of the
        ringing bell is much LOUDER down here.

        Indiana moves to the FIRST DOOR. He REACHES for the handle. The
        Policemen DRAW their pistols. Indy OPENS the door. A LARGE OBJECT
        SHOOTS OUT FROM INSIDE! Rolling TOWARD the men! The policemen FIRE
        their guns. SEVERAL SHOTS ring out. The object comes to a STOP. A DEEP
        RED LIQUID pours out onto the floor. Indy DIPS his finger into the
        liquid. He TASTES.

<b>                                        INDIANA

        The Policemen STARE. WIDE EYED. Indy SMILES.

</b>                        Cabernet sauvignon. 1897.

        Indy's flashlight beam shines ahead, ILLUMINATING the 'mysterious
        object', a WINE BARREL. And inside the room, is a deserted WINE
        CELLAR. Suddenly, a LOUD CREAK echoes through the basement. Galbraith
<b>        CRIES OUT.
</b>
<b>                                        GALBRAITH

                        Look!

        Everyone TURNS. A large STONE DOOR, built into the wall, slowly OPENS.
        Indy and the police stare in AMAZEMENT. The door STOPS. Wide OPEN. A
        FLICKERING LIGHT glimmers from inside. Indiana WALKS to the opening.
        He PEERS into the opening. The Police stay a FEW STEPS behind.

<b>        BEHIND THE DOOR
</b>
        A FAMILY CRYPT. Stone COFFINS, with glass covered tops, line the crypt
        walls. Macabre, ghastly RELIGIOUS STATUES decorate the room. Countless
        DEATH MASKS cover the ceiling, all carved with that same frighteningly
        familiar face... BARON SEAGROVE!

        CAMERA DOLLIES to the far corner of the crypt. It STOPS on a CLOSE-UP
        of the CANDLESTICK! The EXACT candle from upstairs! Still BURNING! It
        rests on one of the coffin's GLASS TOPS.

        A TREMBLING MacGowan steps back, away from the crypt. Be BLURTS an
        order to his men.

<b>                                        MACGOWAN
</b>                        Galbraith... You come with me! We'll
                        search for Hennesey... Out here!
                        Bottomley... You go with Doctor
                        Jones...
                                (finger shaking, points
                                to inside of crypt)
                        In there.

        MacGowan and Galbraith nearly fall over each other as they SCRAMBLE
        away from the crypt. The two DASH OFF into another section of the
        basement. Indy SHAKES his head. He ENTERS the crypt. A reluctant and
        very frightened Bottomley FOLLOWS.

<b>        INT. CRYPT
</b>
        Indy's flashlight beam dances across the glass COFFIN TOPS. Decayed
        CORPSES smile from inside, their hands tightly clutching crucifixes.
        Bottomley is HORRIFIED by the sights. Indiana continues AHEAD. He
        PASSES the burning candle, moving further into the darkness of the
        crypt. The shivering Bottomley stays directly BEHIND Indy. With their
        every step, the bell's ringing grows LOUDER... LOUDER...

        Indiana and Bottomley arrive in a circular CHAMBER, located at the far
        end of the crypt. Here, the ringing bell is nearly DEAFENING. The
        sound echoes from ABOVE. We are on the floor of the BELL TOWER.
        Indiana SHINES his flashlight UPWARD. The beam stops on a RINGING BELL
        that hangs SEVERAL FEET in the air. Inside of the bell, dangling by
        his feet, is the DEAD BODY of

        HENNESEY! He has REPLACED THE BELL CLAPPER! His body SWINGS back and
        forth. It SLAMS into the sides of the bell. Causing the DULL RINGING.

        Bottomley SCREAMS. Indiana GRABS Bottomley's arm.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Let's get outta' here.

        Indy and Bottomley TURN to the crypt door. It begins to CLOSE! The two
        men DASH FORWARD. The door CONTINUES to close. Indy and Bottomley are
        only INCHES away...when the door SLAMS SHUT! They PUSH and KICK at the
        door. NO GOOD. It WON'T BUDGE. A PANICKED Bottomley calls for help.

<b>                                        BOTTOMLEY
</b>                        Inspector MacGowan! Galbraith! Open
                        the door!

        Using his flashlight, Indy SCANS the door, looking for a CRACK,
        another way OUT. Indy NUDGES Bottomley.

<b>                                        INDIANA

                        I need more light.

        Bottomley HURRIES to the candle. He REACHES OUT. There is a LOUD
        WHOOSH! The candle flame GOES OUT! Followed by TOTAL DARKNESS! Indy
        TURNS from the door.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Bottomley?...

        NO answer. Indy SHINES his flashlight toward the area. The candle is
        GONE. There is NO SIGN of Bottomley. Indiana takes a STEP FORWARD.

<b>                                        INDIANA

        AGAIN, no answer. Indy SWEEPS the flashlight beam across the room. It
        PASSES one of the coffins...then SHOOTS BACK! Indy is met with a
<b>        SHOCKING SIGHT!
</b>
        BOTTOMLEY LIES INSIDE THE COFFIN! DEAD! His face twisted in a GHOULISH
        SMILE. All of his bones BROKEN. His hands are wrapped around a
        CRUCIFIX. Indy STARES in horror. There is a SOUND. FOOTSTEPS. There is
        SOMEONE ELSE in here. Indy's flashlight beam DARTS around the crypt.
        There is NO SIGN of anyone.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Who is it?... Who's there?...

        The same crazed LAUGH of a man echoes through the crypt. A CHILLED
        Indy TURNS BACK to the door. He is startled to find the crypt door
<b>        COVERED WITH A THICK SHEET OF ICE!
</b>
        Indy REACHES OUT. He TOUCHES the sparkling, green ice. He SNAPS back
        his hand. His fingers are BURNT.

<b>        INT. BASEMENT
</b>
        MacGowan and Galbraith are OUTSIDE of the crypt door. They PULL at the
        door's metal handles. Trying to OPEN IT. But the door WON'T MOVE.
        MacGowan CALLS through the door.

        Indy ANSWERS, taking a STEP BACK.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Can't! There's some kinda' hot ice
                        coverin' the...

        Indiana suddenly FALLS! The floor has DISAPPEARED FROM BENEATH HIM!

        Indy manages to GRAB HOLD of a stone coffin. His fingers tightly GRIP
        the coffin's edge. Indiana LOOKS DOWN. Beneath him, is a SEVERAL
<b>        HUNDRED FOOT DROP INTO TOTAL DARKNESS!
</b>
        Indy tries to PULL HIMSELF UP. The coffin's ancient stone begins to
        CRUMBLE. Large chunks and pieces FALL from Indy's grasp. He is LOSING
<b>        HIS GRIP.
</b>
        Seconds before he plummets into the abyss, Indiana REACHES inside of
        the coffin. He clutches onto a CORPSE'S ARM! Using the arm, Indy
<b>        SWINGS DOWNWARD.
</b>
<b>        INT. ABYSS
</b>
        At the precise moment, Indiana RELEASES the dead arm. He LANDS on a
        ROCKY LEDGE. Located only a few feet BELOW the open crypt floor. Indy
        STANDS on the ledge. SAFE. He SMILES. RELIEVED. Suddenly, the ledge
<b>        SNAPS!
</b>
        Indiana FALLS! His body DROPS hundreds of feet into the blackness. A
        MOMENT passes. Then... WE HEAR A SPLASH!

<b>        BOTTOM OF THE HOLE!
</b>
        A POOL OF WATER! Surrounded by rocky, cavernous WALLS. Indiana's hat
        FLOATS on the water's surface. Indy POPS OUT of the water, bobbing up
        beside the hat. Indy REACHES for the hat. Suddenly, a FISH flaps out
        of the water. The fish GOBBLES UP one of the hat's live baits and
        disappears back underwater. Indy SMIRKS.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        NOW they bite!

        Indy attempts to PULL himself out of the water. There is a LOUD SOUND.
        Grinding METAL. Rattling CHAINS. Indy's eyes DART to his side.

        TWO HORIZONTAL METAL GATES EJECT FROM THE CAVERN WALLS! They SHOOT
        across the water! Like LIGHTNING! They're headed TOWARD each other...
        and Indy's HEAD!

        Indy DIVES underwater. THE GATES SNAP SHUT! Less than an INCH above
        the water's surface! Indy ATTEMPTS to resurface. The closed gate STOPS
        HIM. He CLUTCHES the grating, trying to MOVE the gate. It's TOO
        STRONG! Indy STRUGGLES for air. NO GOOD. There isn't enough SPACE.
        He's going to DROWN!

<b>        UNDERWATER
</b>
        In desperation, Indy SWIMS downward. Looking for an ALTERNATE ESCAPE.
        But there is NO BOTTOM in sight. Indy's eyes BULGE. His face loses
        COLOR. Only a few precious SECONDS OF LIFE remain...when suddenly, he
        SPOTS SOMETHING. A SMALL TUNNEL. Built into the CAVERN WALL. Indiana
        hurriedly SWIMS to the tunnel. He BOLTS inside.

        A WATER FOUNTAIN. A large, THREE TIERED stone structure. Instead of
        the familiar carvings of angels and beautiful maidens, this fountain
        is surrounded with water spewing DEMONS, GARGOYLES and hellish BEASTS.
        CAMERA DOLLIES TO A LARGE METAL DRAIN, located inside of the
        fountain's base. The drain cover begins to TURN. Suddenly FLIPPING
        OPEN! Indiana CRAWLS out of the opening. He GULPS at the air. COLOR
        returns to his face. LIFE returns to his body. Indy RISES to his feet.
        He finds himself STANDING in the fountain.

<b>        INDY'S POV
</b>
        He is inside of a BANQUET ROOM. The sprawling room is beautifully
        DECORATED in Victorian dignity. The room is IMMACULATE. Not one SPECK
        of dust. Two Medieval SUITS OF ARMOR adorn one wall. A gargantuan
        crystal CHANDELIER hangs above a long, mahogany BANQUET TABLE.

        At the far end of the table, sits a shriveled, white haired ELDERLY
        MAN. It is BARON SEAMUS SEAGROVE III, the fellow whose likeness
        appeared in every piece of artwork. Baron Seagrove is CALMLY eating
        his dinner. A bloated ROASTED PIG rests on a silver platter before
        him. The same candle we saw burning in the upstairs room and the
        family crypt, now RESTS on the table. Directly BESIDE the Baron.

        Two powerful, muscular MASTIFFS are tied to Baron Seagrove's chair.
        Teeth BARED. Eyes AELAZE. The hounds FIGHT for a scrap of meat.

        Indiana stares in BEWILDERMENT at the new surroundings. He STEPS OUT
        of the fountain. Baron Seagrove seems UNAWARE of Indy's presense.
        Indiana WALKS TOWARD the Baron.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Excuse me, sir...? Hello...?

        Baron Seagrove DOES NOT look up from his plate. Indy moves CLOSER. He
        speaks LOUDER.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Canyou hear me?...

<b>        CLOSE-UP: BENEATH THE TABLE
</b>
        Baron seagrove's hand nonchalantly UNTIES the Mastiff's bindings.

<b>        INDIANA
</b>
        still WALKS toward the table. The Baron continues to IGNORE him. Indy
        is ANNOYED.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Listen, pal... There are two dead
                        Policemen upstairs and...

        The Mastiffs LEAP forward. COMING at Indiana. He tries to GET AWAY.
        TOO SLOW. The hounds are UPON HIM. TEARING. CLAWING. BITING. They DRAG
        Indy to the floor.

        Baron Seagrove continues to ENJOY his dinner, seemingly OBLIVIOUS to
        the scene before him.

        Indiana FIGHTS for his life. The VICIOUS dogs tear at his clothing and
        skin. Indy SPOTS something. On the wall ABOVE. Hanging amidst a
        display of stuffed animal heads, is a HUNTER'S TRUMPET. Indy STRUGGLES
        to his knees. Trying to REACH for the horn. But the dogs are still
        BITING. CLAWING. WEAKENING Indiana.

        Indy's fingers are INCHES from the horn. The Mastiffs' sharp claws RIP
        at his arm. But Indy manages to SNATCH the trumpet. He quickly moves
        the horn to his LIPS. He BLOWS. HARD. A HIGH, PIERCING NOTE fills the
        air. The dogs respond to the SOUND. They HALT. STOPPING their attack.
        For a MOMENT.

        Tattered and bruised, Indiana LEAPS to his feet. He DROPS the horn. He
<b>        RUNS.
</b>
        The Mastiffs come to their SENSES. They DART after Indy. Mouths
<b>        FOAMING.
</b>
        Baron Seagrove continues to DINE, still IGNORING the action.

        Indy runs to a VELVET CURTAIN. He GRABS HOLD of a long, thick rope
        that is attached to the curtain. Indiana TEARS the curtain from the
        wall. A large STAINED GLASS WINDOW is behind the curtain.

        The FIRST MASTIFF leaps at Indy. Indiana quickly DRAPES the curtain
        OVER the hound. Indy ties a large KNOT in the open curtain end. The
        dog is TRAPPED.

        Indy TURNS. The SECOND MASTIFF is only a FEW FEET AWAY. BARRELLING
        toward Indy. Indiana HOPS to the window ledge. He OPENS the window.
        The Mastiff LEAPS UPWARD! Indiana JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW! The dog
        FOLLOWS Indy, also JUMPING OUT OF THE WINDOW!

<b>        EXT. WINDOW
</b>
        The Mastiff FALLS. Flying hundreds of feet into the ROCKY WATERS
        BELOW. The hound's vicious howl FADES. CAMERA PANS from the water and
        STOPS ON INDIANA JONES! Indy has OUTSMARTED the Mastiff. Be HANGS onto
        the swinging WINDOW FRAME. SAFE. He LEAPS back inside the room.

<b>        INT. BANQUET ROOM
</b>
        Baron Seagrove pours himself a glass of WINE. A very ANGRY Indiana
        walks toward the Baron.

<b>                                        INDIANA

        The Baron still IGNORES Indiana.

        A SUIT OF ARMOR, located a few feet behind Indy, suddenly TWITCHES.
        Its arm LOWERS. Its head slowly TURNS.

        Indiana still walks TOWARD the Baron, who is only concerned with
        spreading butter on his bread. Indy SHOUTS.

                        hear me?
                                (louder)
                        I want some answers! Now!

        There is a LOUD CREAK OF METAL. A huge, sharp BATTLE AXE SHOOTS INTO
        FRAME! SWINGING toward Indy's head! Indiana SPINS. The axe is only
        INCHES from his face. Indy LEAPS BACK. WHOOSH! The axe SLICES through
        the air. JUST MISSING Indy. The shaken Indiana is SHOCKED to see

        A GLISTENING, BLACK SUIT OF ARMOR! The black knight is nearly SEVEN
        FEET TALL! It has COME TO LIFE and is walking TOWARD Indy. The black
        knight is WILDLY swinging the battle axe. Indiana continues to STEP
        BACK... BACK... Unbeknownst to Indy, his steps are leading him toward

        ANOTHER SUIT OF ARMOR! Also over seven feet tall, this armor is made
        of a SILVERY, WHITE METAL! As Indy moves CLOSER, the WHITE KNIGHT
        OPENS ITS ARMS! When Indy is within reach, the white knight LOCKS its
        powerful arms around Indy's chest! Indiana TRIES to break free. NO
        GOOD. The white knight's grip is TOO TIGHT. Indy is TRAPPED!

        The black knight still COMES TOWARD Indiana. Its frenzied axe SWINGS
        back and forth. Indy still STRUGGLES with the white knight's bone
        crunching grip.

        The black knight is only a FEW FEET from Indy. Its deadly axe blade
        INCHES from Indy's face. Indiana MOVES FAST. He JERKS his body
        forward. This FLIPS the white knight off its feet! OVER Indy's head.
        The white knight FLIES INTO the black knight. CRASH! This sends both
        knights FALLING to the floor.

        Indiana SHOOTS to his feet. The two knights LEAP to their feet. They
        CHASE Indy. The black knight armed with his AXE, the white knight
        armed with a long, sharp SWORD!

        Baron Seagrove SPOONS another helping of boiled potatoes onto his
        plate.

        Indy snatches a SHIELD and SWORD from a nearby wall display. Ready to
        FIGHT. The knights are UPON HIM. Indiana battles BOTH knights. He
        DEFENDS the bludgeoning battle axe with his shield, and SWORDFIGHTS
        the other knight! THRASH! CLANG! The sound of HEAVY METAL fills the
        room!

        Indy's sword STRIKES the white knight's thick chest. The sword SNAPS
        IN TWO. In the confusion, Indy's shield is KNOCKED from his hand by
        the powerful battle axe. Indy is DEFENSLESS.

        The two metal giants RAISE their weapons. HIGH. AIMING for Indy's
        head. The two knights SWING! Indy DIVES to the floor! The knights
        CAN'T STOP their weapons in time... CRUNCH! They deliver a HARD BLOW
        to each other! The woozy knights WOBBLE and SPIN. In a momentary DAZE.
        Indiana JUMPS to his feet.

        The BLACK KNIGHT hisses. FURIOUS. He DASHES after Indiana. The WHITE
        KNIGHT is still REELING from the blow.

        Seeing the black knight in HOT PURSUIT, Indy searches for a WEAPON. He
        spots the curtain's long, thick ROPE. LYING on the floor.

        The black knight is nearly UPON Indy. AXE RAISED! Indiana GRABS the
        rope. He SPINS. FACING the knight. Indy SNAPS HIS WRIST! A LOUD CRACK!
        The rope SHOOTS FORWARD! Not unlike Indiana's familiar WHIP!

        The rope WRAPS itself around the black knight's neck. Indy JERKS the
        whip forward. HARD. This sends the knight FLYING THROUGH THE AIR! The
        knight crashes into the stone FOONTAIN! Several of the fountain's
        sculptures SHATTER into pieces. The dazed, dented black knight
        ATTEMPTS to stand...but LOSES his footing. The knight FALLS backward.
        Into the fountain's WIDE DRAIN OPENING! Its HEAVY ARMOR causes the
        knight to SINK. DISAPPEARING into the hole. Into the POOL OF WATER.

        Indy CATCHES HIS BREATH. The white knight's SWORD SWINGS INTO FRAME!
        SLICING through Indiana's jacket! Indy JUMPS BACK. The vicious white
        knight COMES toward him.

        Indiana TURNS to run. Finding himself at the BANQUET TABLE. Face to
        face with the ROASTED PIG. A few feet away, Baron Seagrove CONTINUES
        to dine. The white knight raises his sword ABOVE Indy. WHOOSH! The
        sword begins to swing DOWN! Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the deadly blows.
        Instead of carving Indiana, the knight's sword manages to SLICE
        perfect sections of the roasted pig. The satisfied Baron HELPS HIMSELF
        to a freshly carved slice of pork.

        Indiana LEAPS onto the table top. Trying to ESCAPE the living suit of
        armor. But the white knight CLIMBS up onto the table. FOLLOWING Indy.

        The sword slashing knight PURSUES Indy along the table top. Indy
        GLANCES upward. To the heavy CHANDELIER. Indy SMILES. A PLAN. He
        continues to STEP BACKWARD. Leading the knight DIRECTLY BELOW the
        chandelier.

        At the precise moment, Indy picks up a STERLING SILVER PLATE from the
        table top. Indy WHISKS the plate in the air. Toward the ROPE that
        holds the chandelier. The spinning plate SEVERS the rope. The
        chandelier FLIES DOWNWARDl! CRASHING ON TOP of the white knight! The
        knight lies BENEATH the chandelier. MOTIONLESS. The sword DROPS from
        its lifeless hand. Onto the TABLE TOP.

        Indy takes the knight's SWORD. Eyes on FIRE, sword OUTSTRETCHED,
        Indiana WALKS across the table top. HEADED for Baron Seagrove.

        The Baron prepares to take ANOTHER BITE of his food. THE SWORD SHOOTS
        INTO FRAME! The tip of the blade RESTS upon Baron Seagrove's rubbery
        throat. Indiana SNARLS.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Haven't you had enough?

        Baron Seagrove finally LOOKS at Indiana. The Baron LOWERS his fork.
        His face twists into an EERIE GRIN. He begins LAUGHING. It's the SAME
        MANIACAL LAUGH we heard earlier. Indy responds by BLOWING OUT the
        flame of the mysterious candle.

        The room's door BURSTS OPEN! INSPECTOR MACGOWAN and GALBRAITH dash
        inside. They HURRY to Baron Seagrove. Their PISTOLS aimed at him.
        Galbraith HANDCUFFS the Baron. MacGowan looks at the BRUISED, BLOODIED
        and TATTERED Indiana Jones.

                        know.

        They EXIT the room.

<b>        EXT. CASTLE
</b>
        The villagers SURROUND the castle. Their BRIGHT TORCHES are raised
        high in the air. Baron Seagrove is LED out of the castle by Indiana
        and the Police. The crowd begins to WHISPER. ANXIOUS. EXCITED. As the
        Baron is led to the POLICE VEHICLE, he turns and LOOKS at Indy. The
        Baron speaks in a TREMBLING, RASPY voice. His eyes are WILD.

<b>                                        BARON SEAGROVE
</b>                        No...jail...can...hold...me.

        A CHILL rushes through Indiana. The Baron turns, CONTINUING to the
        Police wagon. One of the villagers SHOUTS.

<b>                                        VILLAGER
</b>                        'E's done it! Indiana Jones has
                        captured the killer!

        The crowd CHEERS. Indiana gives a HUMBLE NOD and WAVE. MacGowan SHAKES
        Indy's hand. Indy glances to the POLICE VEHICLE.

<b>        INDY'S POV
</b>
        Baron Seagrove CLIMBS into the back compartment of the police vehicle.
        Galbraith CLOSES the vehicle doors. The Baron is still VISIBLE through
        the vehicle's windows. He LIGHTS a cigarette. It appears that the
        MATCH FLAME SHINES THROUGH THE BARON'S BODY! It's as if he were a
<b>        GHOST!
</b>
        Indiana TURNS to the others. Eyes WIDE. SHOCKED. But it is obvious
        that NO ONE else has SEEN the apparition. MacGowan notices the PALE
        expression on Indy's face.

<b>                                        MACGOWAN

                        you've seen a screamin' banshee!

        Indy POINTS back to the police vehicle. But it has already DEPARTED.
        It drives over a far hill, DISAPPEARING INTO THE NIGHT. Indy SIGHS,
        turning back to MacGowan.

<b>                                        INDIANA

<b>        EXT. MARSHALL UNIVERSITY - A FEW DAYS LATER
</b>
        Early AFTERNOON. A RAINY Spring day. Students RUN to the University
        doors, protecting themselves with textbooks.

<b>        INT. INDIANA JONES' OFFICE
</b>
        Rain SPLATTERS the window of this cramped, CLUTTERED room. Crooked
        stacks of dog eared TEXTBOOKS and PAPERS nearly reach the ceiling. The
        spindly bookshelves are stuffed with various ARCHEOLOGICAL RELICS and
        INSTRUMENTS: animal and bird skeletons, fossils, primitive statues,
        etc. Sitting at a small wooden desk, amidst a mountain of TERM PAPERS,
        is INDIANA JONES. Indy is WEARING a brown three piece suit and
        circular, wire rimmed glasses. In one hand, he holds a STUDENT SEAT
        ASSIGNMENT CARD, as he hurriedly READS through the term papers. He
        furiously GRADES each paper.

        To make matters worse; the office is CROWDED WITH STUDENTS, with
        countless others POURING out into the hallway. All of the students are
        ANXIOUS to get inside. They are BADGERING, COMPLAINING and MOANING at
        Indy.

        Indiana continues to grade the papers, trying to IGNORE the verbal
        assault. BETSY TUFFET pushes her way to the front. Betsy is Indy's
        STUDENT ASSISTANT. She is 21 YEARS OLD, with thick, luxurious black
        hair, bright brown eyes and a small framed, athletic body. Betsy is a
        TOUGH. BRASH. A BROOKLYN kid. She moves CLOSE to Indy, her hair
        brushing his cheek. Indiana is very TENSE, continuously working on the

        Priestly HIDES his chuckle. Rebecca THROWS a shirt that obviously
        belongs to Indiana on the desk and STORMS out of the room. Indy shakes
        his head and CONTINUES working. The students are still HARASSING him.
        A LOUD VOICE ECHOES through the room.

        A burly POSTMAN stands in the doorway, holding a thick, enormous BROWN
        ENVELOPE. Indy MOTIONS to the postman. The Postman tries to MAKE his
        way through the crowd. Indiana goes back to his grading, but is
        suddenly INTERRUPTED BY A LOUD TAPPING NOISE. He LOOKS UP. DEAN CLAUDE

                        sign your name?

        Indy GRABS the paper. He's signed a "B+" on the LINE where his name is
        supposed to appear. Indy CROSSES out the grade and signs his name.
        Professor Coventry still LECTURES Indiana.

        At that moment, Indy OPENS the envelope! A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER POURS
        OUT! SATURATING the papers on the desk! This is followed by an
        ENORMOUS DEAD TROUT! It FLOPS onto Indy's desk. The students exchange
        STARTLED and NAUSEOUS glances. Indiana removes a water logged NOTE
        from the envelope. It reads, "A MACGOWAN'S WORD IS TRUER THAN AN
        ANGEL'S KISS". Indiana uses a TISSUE to WIPE some of the water from
        his desk. Dean Coventry SHAKES A FINGER at Indy.

        Indiana HANGS UP. He gives an EMBARASSED look to the furious, red
        faced Dean.

        The Dean STORMS OUT of the room. Indiana GATHERS the wet papers. He
        begins to EXIT the room, EXPLAINING to the students as he makes his
        way through the crowd.

        The large room is filled with skeletons, fossils and statues dating
        back to the DAWN OF MAN. Indiana, his arms cluttered with the soaking
        term papers, hurriedly enters the museum with MARCUS BRODY. Marcus is
        very ANXIOUS. EXCITED. He carries a l6MM METAL FILM CANNISTER beneath

        CLOSE-UP: AN ANCIENT PAINTING. The watercolor features an upright,
        wrinkled face SUN WU KUNG, the STONE MONKEY KING. But the monkey is
        NOT made of stone. He appears to be HALF HUMAN... HALF MONKEY. His
        face is WISE. His coal black eyes are PENETRATING. He wears a LION
        SKIN ROBE, and holds a tall, GOLDEN HOOPED STAFF. Sun Wu Kung stands
        amidst a garden of luscious, ripe PEACE TREES. He is surrounded by a
        HEAVENLY GLOW, a bright ray of light that emanates from an opening in
        the CLOUDS.

        CAMERA PULLS BACK. We are inside of the museum BOARD ROOM. Marcus
        holds the tattered painting before Indiana, who sits at a desk, still
        feverishly GRADING the wet term papers. After he finishes each paper,
        Indy PINS it to a nearby bulletin board for drying. He GLANCES to the
        painting of Sun Wu Kung.

        Indiana finally LOOKS UP from the papers. He glances at Marcus, then
        LOOKS at the painting. CAMERA DOLLIES INTO Indiana's face. He becomes
        very SERIOUS. SOMBER. His eyes are EMPTY. Memories of FAILURE fill his
        head.

        CAMERA PANS BACK to the projected image. Tyki begins to UNSCREW the

        sits at the desk, grading the papers. She is CRYING. Her falling TEARS
        soak the papers. We are INSIDE of Indiana's apartment. LATER that

        INDIANA stands in the background. He is hurriedly PACKING his bags.
        His familiar GUN, HAT and WHIP lie on the bed, beside the suitcase.
        Indy NOTICES that Betsy is crying. He WALKS to Betsy. Indy puts his

        Indiana SIGHS. His eye CATCHES one of the termpapers. He begins to
        READ, making a few CORRECTIONS.

        We see Betsy's HAND removes Indiana's WHIP from the bed.

        Indiana continues to CORRECT the papers. Suddenly, there is a CREAKING
        NOISE. Indy TURNS. His face goes WHITE. He runs OFF SCREEN.

        One end of Indiana's WHIP is attached to an OVERHEAD LAMP. CAMERA PANS
        DOWN the whip. The other end has been formed into a NOOSE around
        Betsy's neck. Sbe stands on a wooden CHAIR. She KICKS AWAY the chair.
        Suddenly GAGGING. Indiana GRABS Betsy in midair. He TAKES the noose
        from her neck and PLACES Betsy on the floor.

        Indiana TOSSES the whip into his suitcase. He pulls up the chair and
        forces Betsy to be SEATED. He pours her a tall glass of BOURBON.

        Indiana WALKS to his suitcase, continuing to pack. His BACK is to
        Betsy. She raises the GLASS to her lips. She PAUSES, reading a MESSAGE
        on the Bourbon bottle. It reads: DANGER! CONTENTS FLAMMABLE! Betsy
        BEAMS. An IDEA. She LIFTS the bottle over her head and begins to DOUSE
        her body with the liquid.

        Indiana is BUSY folding his clothing. Suddenly, we hear the FLICK OF A
        MATCHSTICK! Indy TURNS. He sees the bourbon covered Betsy preparing to
        LIGHT HER BODY ON FIRE! Indy DASHES forward. He BLOWS OUT the match,
        moments before it SPARKS Betsy's clothing. Indy SHAKES Betsy by the
        shoulders.

        Indiana TURNS and finishes his packing. Betsy SIGHS. She notices an
        enormous, STONE AFRICAN URN. The 150 POUND antique sits atop a section
        of BOOKSHELVES.

        Meanwhile, Indiana makes certain that his gun is PACKED. He places the
        familiar HAT on his head and begins to CLOSE the suitcase.

        CLOSE UP: THE AFRICAN URN. It is WOBBLING. SHAKING. Moving CLOSER and
        CLOSER to the edge of the bookshelves. CAMERA PANS TO THE FLOOR. Betsy
        LIES here. Directly BELOW the trembling urn. Betsy SHAKES the
        bookshelves, causing the urn to TILT and SHIVER. The urn is nearly
        HALFWAY OFF of the edge. If it falls...the urn will CRUSH Betsy's
        head.

        Indiana STRUGGLES with closing his tightly packed suitcase.

        The urn FALLS! HEADED STRAIGHT for Betsy! Indiana SUDDENLY GRABS the
        urn. In MIDAIR. Inches before it STRIKES Betsy. Indiana RESTS the urn
        on the floor. He HELPS Betsy to her feet. Betsy WRAPS her arms tightly
        around Indiana.

        Indiana PICKS UP his suitcase and tries to WALK to the door. But
        Betsy's arms are still TIGHTLY WRAPPED around him. Finally, Indy
        STOPS. His eyes BURN through Betsy.

        Chief PORT on the coast. Gateway to the ZAMBESI RIVER. SUPPLY SHIPS,
        SAILBOATS and RAFTS line the marina. The docks are crowded with
        various MERCHANTS and SAILORS, unloading their goods. Small SHOPS and
        RESTAURANTS clutter the waterfront. Behind them are rows of one story,
        low square HOMES. Tall, healthy PALM TREES surround the Area.

        An OCEAN LINER has anchored along the shore. Several PASSENGERS exit
        from the ship. INDIANA steps onto the ocean liner's exit ramp. He is
        UNSHAVEN, wearing his traditional LEATHER JACKET and HAT. Indy LOOKS
        AROUND, expecting to MEET someone.

        There is a a LOUD CAR HORN. Crowds of pedestrians LEAP out of the way.
        A rusted, yellow MODEL-T barrels along the rickety dock. The word
        "TAXI" is crudely painted on the car's trembling doors. The car's
        tires are WOBBLING. LOOSE. Thick, black SMOKE pours from the cracked
        EXHAUST PIPE. The ancient car RATTLES and GRINDS.

        Upon seeing the car, Indiana SMILES.

        At the foot of the ocean liner's ramp, the car SCREECHES TO A STOP!

        TATTERED, DIRTY clothes that are many sizes too large for his SKINNY
        body. Homemade CROCODILE SANDALS flop on his feet.

        Scraggy suddenly breaks into a WILD GRIN. He SPOTS Indiana. Scraggy
        SHOOTS up the exit ramp, running through the crowd of people. Scraggy
        stops a FEW FEET in front of Indiana. Scraggy WAVES his arms before
        him, as if he were BLESSING Indiana. Following this, Scraggy LEAPS
        into Indy's arms. Indiana CRADLES Scraggy like a child. Speaking with

        Indy and Scraggy CONTINUE to walk down the ramp, moving OFF SCREEN.
        CAMERA PANS TO A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM. CAMERA STOPS, as the SCREEN IS
        FILLED WITH A LARGE, BLAZING RED SWASTIKA! CAMERA PANS UPWARD. We see

        of

<b>        SGT. HELMUT GUTTERBUHG
</b>
        A thin, skeletal NAZI. He resembles the ANGEL OF DEATH. Gutterbuhg's
        face is NARROW and SUNKEN. His deep set eyes are a frightening LIGHT
        BLUE. His complexion is PALE. EMOTIONLESS. His hair is BLONDE.
        STRINGY. His right arm appears RIGID. It rests STIFFLY at his side.

        Gutterbuhg FOLLOWS Indy and Scraggy through the crowd. The Nazi
        REMOVES something from his pocket. It is a tiny, MECHANICAL ITEM. It
        resembles a COCKROACH. We see that it is a mini RADIO TRANSMITTER.
        Gutterbuhg WHISPERS into it.

        The mechanical roach's eyes BLINK RED. Gutterbuhg gives a CHILLING

        Meanwhile, Indiana and Scraggy ARRIVE at the Taxi. Scraggy begins to
        SECURE Indy's baggage to the roof. Indy OPENS the rear door of the
        cab. He begins to CLIMB into the back seat. He is met with a SWIFT
        KICK TO THE STOMACH! He FALLS to the ground. The wind KNOCKED out of
        him. Scraggy RUNS to the open door, scolding the person INSIDE.

        sparkling GREEN EYES. She is very PRIM. Very PROPER. But extremely
        INTELLIGENT and QUICK WITTED. She is dressed in KHAKI SLACKS and

        Indiana TURNS. A ship PORTER walks through the crowd, pushing a LARGE
        BARREL on a dolly. Indy WAVES to the Porter. The Porter STOPS in front
        of him.

        The Porter DROPS the barrel in front of Indiana and hurriedly WALKS
        back to the ship.

        SGT. GUTTERBUHG continues to SPY on Indiana. The Nazi HIDES a few feet
        away. In a DARK alleyway.

        A puzzled Indiana begins to OPEN the barrel. Scraggy SHOUTS a warning.

        Indiana GRUMBLES. An amused Dr. Clarke gets back into the car. Indy
        SHOVES Betsy inside. He is FURIOUS.

        Before Indiana gets into the car, GUTTERBUHG steps out from the
        alleyway. He TOSSES the tiny mechanical COCKROACH at Indiana. The
        roach ATTACHES itself to Indy's TROUSER LEG. The tiny transmittor is
        very LIGHT. Indiana can feel NOTHING. He gets INTO the car. Scraggy
        BLESSES the Taxi and gets into the driver's seat.

        Gutterbuhg WATCHES as the battered Model-T DRIVES OFF. The NAZI turns,
        walking in an opposite direction. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Gutterbuhg, as he
        enters a SEEDY WATERFRONT HOTEL.

<b>        INT. HOTEL
</b>
        Gutterbuhg walks through the DIMLY LIT lobby, filled with dusty, tacky
        African furnishings. He turns a corner, into a NARROW, decrepid
        hallway. He STOPS at the last DOORWAY. Room 113. He OPENS the door
        with a key and ENTERS.

<b>        INT. ROOM

        TWO CHAIRS and A FIRE PLACE. Two BIZARRE AFRICAN STATUES adorn the
        fireplace mantle. Gutterbuhg carefully LOCKS the room door. He walks
        to the FIREPLACE. He TILTS one of the African statues forward. There
        is a mechanical, CREAKING SOUND. Suddenly, the SOFA BEGINS TO MOVE. It
        SLIDES a few feet, revealing an OPENING BENEATH THE FLOOR. A STAIRCASE
        leads into the opening. Gutterbuhg DESCENDS the stairs.

<b>        INT. OPENING

        Gutterbuhg enters a LARGE, BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM. We are inside of A

        are seated before the equipment, monitoring various radio signals. An

        Gutterbuhg turns to KLAUS, a hulking Nazi who stands in the corner.
        Pointing to Klaus' FEET, Gutterbuhg SHOUTS an order to Klaus. CAMERA
        PANS to Klaus' feet. The Nazi's BOOT IS UNTIED. A LONG STRING dangles
        on the floor. The embarassed Klaus KNEELS and sloppily RE-TIES his
        shoe.

        Gutterbuhg turns to a Nazi who sits at a RADIO RECEIVER. The Nazi
        wears HEADPHONES, LISTENING for a transmission. THE LONG, FRIGHTENING
        SHADOW OF A MAN overcomes Gutterbuhg. He TURNS. FEAR covers
        Gutterbuhg's face. The shadow RAISES its arm. HEIL HITLER! Gutterbuhg
        also RAISES his right arm. But a BIZARRE, MECHANICAL SQUEAK, is caused
        by the movement of his arm.

        stands BEFORE Gutterbuhg. Mephisto is a NAZI nightmare. His face is
        THICK and BULLISH. His bulging eyes are a reddish BROWN, giving him
        the appearance of a DEMON from hell. He has NO FACIAL HAIR. NO
        eyebrows. NO eyelashes. Completely BALD. His body is THICK. MUSCULAR.
        He is over SIX FEET TALL. He GLARES down at Gutterbuhg.

        Gutterbuhg gives a TIMID NOD. With trembling fingers, he reaches over
        and TURNS UP THE VOLUME of the radio transmission. The voices of
        Indiana, Betsy, Clare and Scraggy echo through a TINNY SPEAKER.
        Mephisto manages a pleased GRUNT.

<b>        EXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND
</b>
        A miniature ZOO. The PEACEFUL compound is surrounded with small man
        made lakes and palm trees. There are countless METAL CAGES, filled
        with various ANIMALS. The TIGERS, LIONS, GORILLAS and other violent
        creatures, are kept BEHIND BARS. But the LLAMAS, GIRAFFES, DEER and
        various tame animals are FREE to roam the compound grounds.

        Indiana ENTERS with Clare, Betsy and Scraggy. The persistant Betsy is
        ANNOYING Indy. She attempts to SNUGGLE closer to him. Indiana PUSHES
        her away. Betsy TRIES to hold his hand. Indy SHAKES her loose. Scraggy
        WATCHES all of this, GIGGLING to himself.

        We hear SINGING. A high, pitched BEAUTIFUL VOICE. Clare walks to the
        far end of the compound, toward the SINGING. The others FOLLOW. Betsy
        walks by BONZO, A LARGE CHIMPANZEE. As Betsy PASSES, the chimp catches
        a FAMILIAR SMELL. Bonzo begins to FOLLOW Betsy.

        Clare OPENS the door of a large metal cage. Here, the singing is
        LOUDER. Clare ENTERS the cage. Indiana FOLLOWS. Scraggy BLESSES the
        cage, then enters. Betsy MOVES to go inside, but Bonzo's LARGE HAIRY
        HAND REACHES OUT and GRABS BETSY! PULLING the girl OFF SCREEN!

<b>        INT. CAGE
</b>
        Filled with hand made wooden and bamboo FURNITURE. TYKI, the adorable
        PYGMY from Marcus' film, is INSIDE. Tyki is dressed only in a BELTED,
        leather loin cloth and SANDALS. He is perched on the floor, working on
        a large TAPESTRY. The tapestry depicts a colorful picture of CLOUDS.
        The buildings of a LARGE CITY are REFLECTED on the clouds. Tyki
        pleasantly SINGS as he does his work.

        Upon hearing the cage door OPEN, Tyki LOOKS UP. He SEES Clare. A
        JOYOUS SMILE covers his face. The pygmy RUNS to Clare, giving her a
        huge HUG and a KISS. Clare INTRODUCES Tyki to the others.

        Tyki EXTENDS his right hand. He SHAKES Indiana's hand. Indiana is
        CHARMED by the civilized display of friendship. Indy SMILES at Clare.

        Clare pauses, noticing that Betsy is MISSING. Clare suddenly breaks
        into a LAUGH! She points OFF SCREEN. Everyone TURNS.

<b>        EXT. COMPOOND
</b>
        Bonzo is being extremely AFFECTIONATE toward Betsy. The chimpanzee
        PULLS and GRABS at Betsy. It is all VERY SIMILIAR to what Betsy has
        been doing to Indiana. Betsy WRESTLES with Bonzo, CALLING Indy for
        help.

                        sounds. Whimpering. Moaning. I took
                        a few steps, and found Tyki. He was
                        lying in a shallow swamp...semi
                        conscious...a high fever...nearly
                        dead from exhaustion. He had
                        obviously been travelling on foot
                        for many days, over countless

                        the compound...nursed him back to

        Indiana STARES at the pygmy. A skeptical look COVERS his face.

        Clare OPENS a door at the rear of the cage. It LEADS into another
        room, directly behind the CAGE. Clare and Indiana ENTER. Scraggy STAYS
        behind. He EXCHANGES a friendly smile with Tyki. Meanwhile, in the

        Insulted, Betsy GOBBLES down her glass of wine and TURNS back to
        Indiana, who is still deeply CONCENTRATING on the scrolls.

<b>        UNDER THE TABLE
</b>
        Betsy's FOOT reaches across the floor. It RESTS on Indy's leg. Betsy
        begins to RUB against Indiana's trouser leg. The red eyed MECHANICAL
        BUG is still attached to Indiana's trousers.

<b>        INDIANA
</b>
        GLARES at Betsy. Clare REACHES for her cup of coffee. She NOTICES that
        the coffee cup trembles SLIGHTLY. Clare GLANCES beneath the table, and
        sees Betsy RUBBING Indy's leg. Clare is DISGUSTED.

        ABOVE the table, Clare shoots a scowl of DISAPPROVAL at Indy. A
        FLUSTERED Indy tries to explain...but is suddenly INTERRUPTED by a
        hand on his shoulder. It is DASHIELL, the suave, HANDSOME owner of the

        Indiana's eyes DART around the room. He sees the VARIOUS NAZIS.
        WATCHING him. Indy gives a CONFIDENT SMILE. A WORRIED Dashiell

        DARK. SILENT. Many of the animals are ASLEEP in their cages. A
        SECURITY GUARD keeps watch on the compound. He STANDS outside of the
        METAL GATES. There is a SUDDEN SOUND. The guard TURNS.

        THE FIGURES OF THREE MEN stand before him. In the SHADOWS. The NERVOUS
        Guard places a hand on his holster.

        We hear a MECHANICAL CREAK. A MAN'S LEATHER GLOVED HAND extends from
        the shadows. The hand's FINGER is POINTED at the Security GUARD.

<b>        CLOSE UP: VARIOUS ANIMALS
</b>
        The sound of RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE echoes throughout the camp! CAMERA
        RECORDS the animal's SHOCKED REACTIONS!

<b>        THE SECURITY GUARD
</b>
        lies on the GROUND. DEAD. His body riddled with BULLETS. The SHINY,
        BLACK BOOTS of the three men PASS his body. We notice that one of the
        boot's SHOELACES are untied.

<b>        TYKI
</b>
        STARES into the dark night. FEAR covers his face. He is SEATED inside
        of his cage. A CANDLE flickers beside him. Tyki's hands REST on the
        beautiful tapestry. Tyki LISTENS. He hears FOOTSTEPS. COMING toward
        his cage. Tyki REACHES to his side. He grabs a STONE DAGGER.

        Suddenly, a LOOD GONSHOT! The SPLINTERED LOCK from Tyki's cage goes
        spinning across the floor. The cage door CREAKS OPEN.

        GUTTERBUHG stands in the doorway. TWO NAZI SOLDIERS, HELMUT and KLACE
        (who we met earlier), are beside him. Gutterbuhg SMILES. His stiff
        right arm EXTENDS from his side. His leather gloved INDEX FINGER is
        POINTING ahead.

        Tyki GROWLS at the Nazis. He STANDS. RAISING the stone dagger OVER HIS
<b>        HEAD.
</b>
        Gutterbuhg's FINGER BEGINS TO RAPIDLY FIRE BULLETS! His MECHANICAL ARM
        is actually a A MACEINE GUN!

        The bullets TEAR through Tyki's tapestry. They make a crooked,
        tattered line through the BEAUTIFOL WORK. DESTROYING it. A terrified
        Tyki WATCHES.

        Gutterbuhg STOPS shooting. He REMOVES the empty cartridge from a SLOT
        in his mechanical arm, and REPLACES it with another. He points the
        DEADLY FINGER at Tyki. A trembling Tyki DROPS the dagger. The three
        NAZIS walk toward the helpless pygmy.

        TREMBLING. Clare PEEKS under the table, and again SEES Betsy's foot
        RUBBING Indiana's leg. Clare gives a revolted GRUMBLE. Indiana

        down, trying to SLAP Betsy's foot away! But Indy's hand STUMBLES upon
        something else. The MECHANICAL BUG. Indy TRIES to remove the bug. But
        the tiny device WON'T BUDGE.

        Indiana's hand is buried beneath the table, STRUGGLING to remove the

        over something. A FAWN. Klaus GROWLS. He SHOUTS a German order to
        Helmut, who GRABS a tight hold of the baby deer. Klaus AIMS his luger
        at the fawn's head. Gutterbuhg and Helmut exchange a chilling LAUGH.
        Tyki stares in HORROR. Klaus CLICKS the luger...ready to SHOOT...

        There is an earth shattering CRACK! A WHIP SHOOTS INTO FRAME! The whip
        WRAPS ITSELF around the luger! TEARING the gun OUT of Klaus' hand! The
        fawn breaks FREE and RUNS OFF. The Nazis exchange a SHOCKED glance.
        They TURN and SEE

        POINTS to Tyki, angrilly SHOUTING to the Nazis.

        Gutterbuhg LAUGES. He POINTS his finger at Indiana. Indy is PUZZLED.
        The finger begins to SHOOT! RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE! Indy DIVES for
        cover.

        Holding Tyki CAPTIVE, the Nazis TURN and begin to RUN out of the
        compound. Indy gets to his FEET. He LIFTS his gun. Ready to SHOOT. But
        the Nazis are running behind SEVERAL ROWS OF CAGES, filled with
        ANIMALS. Indiana CAN'T SHOOT. He dashes back OUTSIDE.

<b>        EXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND

        Located on the WATERFRONT. Countless rows of LONG, WOODEN DOCKS line
        the marina. The Nazis run to below a ROTTED, ANCIENT DOCK. Here, one
        of their SPEEDBOATS waits. Motor RUNNING. RUDOLPH, a pudgy Nazi, is at
        the wheel. The Nazis hurriedly CLIMB into the speedboat, PUSHING Tyki
        inside with them.

        Indy RUNS to Scraggy's Model-T. Scraggy SITS in the driver's seat.
        Betsy and Clare SIT in the rear. A drunk Betsy still sings "Night and
        Day". Indy leaps onto the SIDEBOARD. He SEES the Nazis ahead, CLIMBING
        into the speedboat. Indy motions for Scraggy to DRIVE. FAST. TOWARD
        the dock.

        The Nazi speedboat SHOOTS FORWARD. Moving BENEATH the dock.

        Scraggy's Model-T FOLLOWS ABOVE, along the SHAKY dock. Indiana RIDES
        the car's rusted sideboard. He SEES the speedboat below, through the
        WIDE OPENINGS in the dock's slated boards. Indy begins to SHOOT at the
        Nazis. Gutterbuhg raises his mechanical arm, FIRING SHOTS back at
        Indiana.

        Machine gun fire SPLINTERS the dock boards, SLICING through the
        Model-T. The side mirror is BLASTED to pieces. The floor beneath Betsy
        and Clare erupts with FLYING BULLETS. JUST MISSING the girls. Clare is
        HORRIFIED. Betsy laughs HYSTERICALLY.

        The Model-T is less than TWENTY FEET from the end of the dock. If they
        continue ahead, the car will PLUNGE SEVERAL FEET INTO THE WATER! But
        Scraggy doesn't take his FOOT from the gas.

        GUTTERBUHG smiles, seeing the vast ocean ahead. Knowing he's almost

        Helmut POINTS his gun at Indy. Indy reacts with a SWIFT KICK to
        Helmut's jaw. The Nazi HITS the deck. OUT COLD. Klaus COMES for Indy.
        They begin to FIGHT. An angry Gutterbuhg tries to SHOOT... But Indy
        and Klaus move TOO QUICKLY! Gutterbuhg CAN'T get a clear shot.

        The Model-T has COME TO A STOP. SAFE. Its front wheels TEETER over the
        dock's edge. Scraggy, Betsy and Clare GET OUT. Clare CATCHES her
        breath. Knees SHAKING. Betsy is still LAUGHING.

<b>                                        BETSY

        A WORRIED Scraggy sees Indiana, FIGHTING with the Nazis.

<b>                                        SCRAGGY
</b>                        Bad spirits have Indy! He in
                        trouble! Big trouble!

        Scraggy RUNS OFF SCREEN.

        The Nazi speedboat is HEADED TOWARD THE SIDE OF AN ENORMOUS OCEAN
        LINER! Gutterbuhg RADIOS for help. Indiana and Klaus continue to
        FIGHT. ROLLING along the deck. Exchanging PUNCHES. A bound Tyki
        watches with WIDE EYES. HELPLESS.

        The speedboat makes a sudden SHARP TURN. AVOIDING A COLLISION with the
        Ocean liner. Indiana and Klaus TUMBLE OFF, THE BOAT! INTO THE WATER!

<b>        UNDERWATER
</b>
        Indiana and Klaus CONTINUE their battle. They wrestle only a few feet
        from the ship's large, SPINNING STEEL PROPELLERS. The propellers
        create a SUCTION FORCE. DRAWING Indy and Klaus CLOSER... CLOSER...
        toward a SPINNING DEATH.

        Indy and Klaus grab hold of a dangling, STEEL ANCHOR. PREVENTING their
        bodies from being sucked into the propellers. Klaus PULLS a
        switchblade from his pocket. He ATTACKS Indy's CLENCHED FINGERS with
        the knife. Indy begins to LOSE HIS GRIP. His body INCHES toward the
        propellers. Klaus RAISES the knife, to FINISH OFF Indiana...

        But Klaus' UNTIED SHOELACE dangles beside the propellers. The shoelace
        CATCHES a spinning blade. The SHOCKED Nazi is pulled INTO THE
<b>        PROPELLERS!
</b>
        Indiana TURNS AWAY, holding TIGHTLY to the anchor. A BLOOD RED CLOUD
        surges through the surrounding water. Indiana CLIMBS the anchor to
        safety.

<b>        ABOVE WATER
</b>
        Indiana SURFACES. Taking a GULP of air. Suddenly, the water in front
        of him erupts with MACHINE GUN FIRE. Indiana SEES

        GOTTERBUHG! He has PARKED the Nazi speedboat only a FEW FEET AWAY.
        Gutterbuhg SMILES, pointing his FINGER at the helpless Indiana. A
        SITTING DUCK. Gutterbuhg SMILES.

<b>                                        GUTTERBUHG
</b>                        Goodnight, Doctor Jones.

        There is a LOUD GUNSHOT! Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm is HIT BY A
        BULLET! Pieces of SPRING, METAL and SPROCKETS fly from the wound.
        Gutterbuhg TURNS. FURIOUS.

        DASHIELL, the nightclub owner, is a few feet away. He is driving a
        sleek SPEEDBOAT, its side adorned with the AMERICAN FLAG. Dashiell
        points a PISTOL at Gutterbuhg, ready to take ANOTHER SHOT...

        With a ROAR, The Nazi speedboat DRIVES AWAY! Toward a CLUSTER OF
        DOCKS! Indiana CLIMBS into Dashiell's speedboat.

<b>                                        DASHIELL
</b>                        Scraggy said you might be needing
                        some help, sport.

        Dashiell HITS the gas. TEARING after the Nazis.

        A FRENZIED, HIGH SPEED CHASE BEGINS! Through the DARKNESS. Beneath the
        ROWS OF DOCKS. The speedboats face countless OBSTACLES. They SWERVE
        around a virtual forest of wooden poles, which FLY BY AT BREAKNECK
        SPEED! The men DUCK and DODGE dangling FISH HOOKS and NETS. Many paths
        are BLOCKED by the wooden RAFTS and ROWBOATS. (NOTE: Because of the
        darkness, these obstacles APPEAR only when they are a FEW FEET AHEAD
        of the speedboats. This makes the chase completely SURPRISING and
        SCARY, causing a FUNHOUSE effect.)

        Throughout the chase, Indiana and the Nazis continue to exchange
        GUNFIRE. A frustrated Gutterbuhg CAN'T SHOOT. His mechanical-machine
        gun arm rendered USELESS by Dashiell's bullet. He continues to RADIO
        Nazi headquarters for help.

        Dashiell CATCHES UP with the Nazis. The two speedboats travel SIDE BY
        SIDE. Their edges SCRAPE together. SPARKS fly. The recovered Helmut
        AIMS his luger at Indiana... But Indy LEAPS toward the Nazi. The two
        FALL. ROLLING. TUMBLING. STRUGGLING for the gun. They fight BETWEEN
        the two speedboats. The crack below them slightly OPENING and CLOSING.

        Up ahead, an ENORMOUS STONE POLE appears. To AVOID a collision, the
        speedboats MUST SEPARATE. Dashiell SCREAMS.

<b>                                        DASHIELL
</b>                        Indy! Rollout!

        Indy FREES himself from Helmut and ROLLS back onto Dashiell's boat.
        Helmut LOOKS UP. He sees the stone pole AHEAD. COMING AT HIM. Helmut
        tries to MOVE...TOO LATE. The two boats SEPARATE. Helmut SMACKS into
        the pole! CRUSHED!

        Dashiell TURNS AWAY from the wheel, looking at Indiana.

<b>                                        DASHIELL
</b>                        You okay, sport?

        Indiana begins to answer...then sees SOMETHING. AHEAD. He SCREAMS.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Dash!...

        Dashiell TURNS BACK. The speedboat is HEADED STRAIGHT FOR A SOLID
        WOODEN WALL! A sign on the wall reads: FUTTERMAN'S FISHING WAREHOUSE.

        The Nazi speedboat has already made a SHARP TURN, AVOIDING the
        warehouse. There's NO TIME for Dashiell to TURN. Indy HITS the deck.
        The speedboat ARCHES upward, at an ANGLE... CRASH! The speedboat
        BLASTS into the warehouse. Splintered wood SPLATTERS through the air.

<b>        INT. WAREHOUSE
</b>
        Dashiell's speedboat BURSTS through another wall. The boat SKIDS
        across the warehouse floor. SCREECHING TO A STOP! A SHAKEN Dashiell
        gets out. Indy RUNS to the window.

<b>        INDIANA'S POV
</b>
        The NAZI SPEEDBOAT shoots out of the docks, ESCAPING across the water.

        Indiana grabs his WHIP. He KICKS OPEN the warehouse window. He SNAPS
        his wrist. CRACK. The whip SHOOTS forward, ATTACHING ITSELF TO THE
        REAR OF THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! Indy firmly GRIPS his end of the whip. The
        whip TIGHTENS. WHOOSH! Indiana is PULLED out of the window.

        Gutterbuhg exchanges a VICTORIOUS laugh with Rudolph, the speedboat
        driver, thinking they have LOST Indiana. A frightened Tyki LOOKS BACK.
        His eyes suddenly fill with HOPE. Gutterbuhg TURNS. His mouth DROPS
<b>        OPEN.
</b>
        Indiana uses his WHIP to WATER SKI BEHIND THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! A red
        faced Gutterbuhg SLAMS his fist on the dashboard. He removes a SHARP
        KNIFE. He hurriedly begins to SLICE through Indy's whip. Trying to
<b>        BREAK THE CONNECTION.
</b>
        Indiana AIMS his pistol at Gutterbuhg. But suddenly, a SHOT WHIZZES by
        Indy's head. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. COMING from behind.
        Indy TURNS. A SECOND NAZI SPEEDBOAT is in HOT PURSUIT! There are FIVE
        NAZIS inside. Armed with PISTOLS and RIFLES. All FIRING SHOTS at
        Indiana.

        Meanwhile, Gutterbuhg's knife continues to SLICE through Indy's whip.
        Only a FEW THREADS remain.

        Indiana performs some EXPERT WATER SKIING. SWERVING. SPINNING.
        JUMPING. All in an attempt to AVOID the flying bullets from behind.
        Suddenly, Indy's whip SNAPS! Indiana FALLS UNDERWATER! Directly IN THE
        PATH of the seccnd Nazi speedboat!

        Tyki HIDES his eyes. Gutterbuhg LAUGHS. It appears that Indiana has
        met a GRISLY DEATH.

        The Nazis in the second speedboat are DELIGHTED. SHAKING each other's
        hands. CAMERA PANS TO BELOW the speedboat. We move UNDERWATER. SOUND
        TRACK MUSIC SOARS! We see INDIANA. Very much ALIVE. He STRADDLES THE
        BOTTOM OF THE SPEEDING BOAT! HOLDING ON with all of his strength!
        Indiana CLIMBS toward the side of the speedboat, BATTLING the pressure
        of the rushing water.

<b>        CAMERA FOLLOWS INDIANA, OUT OF THE WATER, AS HE CLIMBS ABOARD THE
</b>        SECOND SPEEDBOAT. The four Nazis are LAUGHING. TALKING. Their backs
        turned to the APPROACHING Indiana. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy GRABS
        one of the Nazis and TOSSES HIM OVERBOARD. With a SWIFT PUNCH to the
        stomach and jaw, Indy sends another Nazi INTO THE WATER. The other two
        Nazis TACKLE Indy. They FALL to the deck. FIGHTING.

        Gutterbuhg LOOKS BACK. SHOCKED that Indy is still alive. Gutterbuhg
        GROWLS. FRUSTRATED. His eyes suddenly LIGHT. He SPOTS something.
<b>        AHEAD.
</b>
<b>        TWO GARGANTUAN OCEAN LINERS
</b>
        are MOVING TOWARD EACH OTHER. Coming TOGETHER. There is an OPENING
        between the two ships, that continues to get SMALLER, as the ships
        move CLOSER.

        Gutterbuhg SMILES. An IDEA. He orders Rudolph to DRIVE THROUGH THE
<b>        OPENING.
</b>
        In the second speedboat, the Nazis have OVERCOME Indiana. One Nazi
        PINS Indy down. The other removes a THICK METAL CHAIN from his neck. A
        RED SWASTIKA dangles from the chain. The Nazi WRAPS the chain around
        Indy's neck. He begins to STRANGLE Indiana.

        Gutterbuhg's speedboat MOVES TOWARD the ocean liners. The opening
        between the two ships continues to SHRINK. Getting SMALLER...and
<b>        SMALLER...
</b>
        The second speedboat is DIRECTLY BEHIND Gutterbuhg. The Nazis are
        STRANGLING Indiana. The color begins to LEAVE Indy's face. He GASPS
        for air.

        The opening between the two Ocean liners continues to get SMALLER...
        Less than TEN FEET WIDE. Gutterbuhg's speedboat is only a FEW FEET
<b>        AWAY.
</b>
        Through his fluttering eyes, Indiana SEES Gutterbuhg's speedboat
        headed for the ocean liners. Indiana is nearly UNCONSCIOUS. The
        giggling Nazis TIGHTEN the chain around his neck.

        With LESS THAN AN INCH to spare... Gutterbuhg's speedboat SQUEEZES
        between the two Ocean Liners!

        The second speedboat is only a FEW FEET from the Ocean Liners. But as
        the ships move CLOSER...the opening is nearly CLOSED. The driver CAN'T
        TURN AWAY. He's TOO CLOSE. He emits a SCREAM. The Nazis PAUSE from
        strangling Indiana. They TURN.

        Indy MOVES FAST. He DIVES overboard. INTO THE WATER.

        The speedboat HITS the opening. TOO SMALL. The speedboat is CRUSHED
        between the two Ocean Liners. The Nazis let out their FINAL SCREAMS.
        Followed by a fiery EXPLOSION! Flaming pieces of the wreckage are
        SPLATTERED through the night sky.

        GOTTERBUHG turns. His grinning, sadistic face LIT by the explosion.
        Tyki's eyes are filled with FEAR.

        SEVERAL FEET AWAY, Indiana Jones SURFACES. ALIVE. He SWIMS to the
        nearby shore and CLIMBS out of the water. He RUBS his reddened neck,
        catches his breath and LOOKS into the distance. Indy SEES Gutterbuhg's
        speedboat. TOO FAR to catch.

        GUTTERBUHG sees the SILHOUETTE of Indy, standing on the distant shore.
        Gutterbuhg orders the driver to move FASTER. The engine ROARS.
        Gutterbuhg LOOKS back at Indy. The Nazi emits a MANIACAL LAUGH that
        pierces the air.

        Indiana watches the speedboat ESCAPE into the night. His eyes fill
        with RAGE. VENGEANCE. Clare, Scraggy and a VERY DRUNK Betsy JOIN Indy
        on the shore. Betsy PUTS her arms around Indiana. She RESTS her head
        on his shoulder. She CLOSES her eyes and emits a DRUNKEN SIGH.

<b>                                        BETSY
</b>                        What a romantic night!

        An ANNOYED Indy pushes Betsy away. In a drunken stupor, Betsy moves to
        the next person, CLARE. Thinking she's still with Indiana, Betsy puts
        her arms AROUND Clare. A WORRIED Clare is TOO CONCERNED with the
        departing Nazi speedboat. Clare TURNS to Inqy.

<b>                                        CLARE

        Eyes CLOSED, resting her head on Clare's shoulder, Betsy SIGHS.

        Clare PUSHES Betsy away. Betsy SPINS and WRAPS HER ARMS around
        Scraggy. Clare watches the Nazi Speedboat DISAPPEAR into the night.

<b>                                        CLARE

        Betsy, still thinking she's SNUGGLING with Indiana, rubs her face
        against Scraggy's bristly beard.

                        shave. It's so sexy!

        Scraggy PUSHES Betsy away. She SPINS, this time putting her arms
        around a hanging FISHERMAN'S NET. Filled with FISH. Meanwhile, Scraggy
        LOOKS at Indiana and Clare.

<b>                                        SCRAGGY

                        they'll wipe out one of the greatest
                        archeological finds in History!

        Indiana turns and WALKS AWAY. Clare and Scraggy hurriedly FOLLOW.
        There's NO TIME to lose. The drunken Betsy continues to embrace the
        net of DEAD FISH. Betsy TURNS. Eyes CLOSED. She SMILES.

        Betsy OPENS her eyes. FACE TO FACE with the dead fish. Betsy SCREAMS
        and RUNS toward the departing Indiana, Clare and Scraggy!

<b>        EXT. ZAMBESI RIVER - THE FOLLOWING DAY
</b>
        Early MORNING. The sparkling waters of the Zambesi are lined by thick
        JUNGLE. Sounds of screeching GIBBONS, exotic BIRDS, chattering
        INSECTS, and various other WILDLIFE echo from the jungle. BRIGHT RAYS
        of HOT sunlight sprinkle through the leaves of the towering palm
        trees.

        A 55 foot, tattered, wooden RIVER BOAT, the "ADOBO", travels along the
        Zambesi. The boat is filled with various crates and barrels of
        SUPPLIES. And there are several men, CREW MEMBERS, all natives of
        Mozambique. They are a MOTLEY crew, all armed with SWORDS and DAGGERS.
        They are DIRTY. TATTERED. UNKEMPT. The boat pulls a long, WOODEN RAFT
        behind it. Scraggy's MODEL-T is attached to the raft. One of the crew
        members, a YOUNG MAN, sits on the raft. He strums a BEATEN GUITAR,
        singing a FOLK SONG.

        INDIANA stands at the ship's steering wheel. Forehead COVERED with
        sweat. He GUIDES the ship along the twisting waters. CLARE exits from
        a cabin, carrying a stenographer's NOTEBOOK. She looks RADIANT. Her
        red hair SHIMMERS in the morning sun. Clare walks up BESIDE Indy. She
        CRINKLES her nose.

        Indy points OFF SCREEN. Scraggy, fully clothed, STANDS here. He rubs a
        large, FRESH ONION over his FACE, ARMS and LEGS. SQUEEZING the onion
        JUICE over his body. Indiana EXPLAINS to a befuddled Clare.

        EXTENDS a hand. The hand GRABS Indy's blanket. Indy WAKES. He LEAPS
        out of bed and TACKLES the mysterious person. Indy FLIPS on the cabin
        lamp. The intruder is none other than...BETSY. Indiana PULLS Betsy to
        her feet. She gives a flirtatious SMILE.

<b>                                        BETSY
</b>                        Couldn't sleep. The heat. I'm in the
                        mood for passion.

</b>                        I'm in the mood for isolation.

        Indiana LEADS Betsy to the open door. He begins to PUSH her back
        outside. Betsy STOPS him.

<b>                                        BETSY
</b>                        I'm not leaving. Not till I get a
                        kiss.

                        One kiss. Or I'll scream. I swear.
                        I'll wake the whole boat.

        Indiana has NO CHOICE. He SIGHS.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        OKay. Just one.
                                (leans toward her,
                                pauses)
                        Keep your mouth closed.

        They KISS. Betsy WRAPS her arms around Indiana, turning it into a
<b>        PASSIONATE KISS.
</b>
        At that moment, ACROSS THE HALL, Clare exits the bathroom, TOOTHBRUSH
        in hand. She SEES the kissing Indiana and Betty. Clare STARES. OPEN
        MOUTHED. SHOCKED. Indiana OPENS his eyes. He SEES Clare WATCHING HIM.
        An ANGRY Clare MARCHES into her room. She SLAMS the door. WE HEAR
        Clare LOCKING the door behind her, and moving a piece of furniture in
        front of the door. Indiana PUSHES Betsy away. ANGRY. He quickly CLOSES
        his door. Betsy WALKS back to her room. A huge, SATISFIED SMILE covers
        her face.

<b>        THE FOLLOWING MORNING
</b>
        SUNRISE. PEACEFUL. CALM. Birds SING. The River Boat has travelled
        countless miles, into the heart of the ZAMBESI. A tired CREW MEMBER
        mans the boat's steering wheel. CAMERA PANS DOWN, moving along the
        side of the boat. WE STOP AT WATER LEVEL. A HAND SHOOTS OUT OF THE
        WATER. GRIPPING a rusted, sharp KNIFE. Followed by ANOTHER HAND. And
        ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Until there are COUNTLESS HANDS, REACHING FOR
        THE SIDE OF THE RIVER BOAT. The hands GRAB HOLD of the boat. SEVERAL
        DARK FIGURES slowly RISE out of the water. Only the OUTLINES of their
        bodies are VISIBLE, backlit by the RISING SUN. The figures CLIMB UP
        the side of the boat. Carefully CREEPING. Moving SILENTLY.

        Indiana stands on the REAR DECK, shirt WRAPPED around his waist. He is
        SHAVING. CLARE sits a few feet away. WRITING in her journal. Indy
        GLANCES to her. CURIOUS.

                        Very funny.

        CAMERA PANS TO THE FRONT DECK. STOPPING on the DRIVER. He STARES
        ahead. STEERING the ship. SUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS. BEHIND the
        driver. The figure GRABS the driver. AROUND THE NECK. Before the
        driver can SCREAM...the figure SLICES HIS THROAT.

        Scraggy WITNESSES this. Through an OPEN PORTHOLE. His face covered
        with SHOCK. FEAR.

<b>        INT. LOWER CABIN - KITCHEN
</b>
        Betsy stands over a large SKILLET. She FRIES pancakes, LIFTING the
        first pancake, Betsy places it on a PLATE that rests beside her. Betsy
        TURNS to get another pancake. A HAND REACHES FROM OFF SCREEN. The hand
        GRABS the pancake from the plate. Betsy TURNS back. She sees the EMPTY
        PLATE. She is PUZZLED. CONFUSED. She SHRUGS, placing ANOTHER PANCAKE
        on the plate. She TURNS back to the skillet. Again, a hand GRABS the
        pancake. Betsy turns and again sees an EMPTY PLATE. She hears
        GIGGLING. BEHIND her. She turns and SEES

        AN ORIENTAL PIRATE. TALL. MUSCULAR. The Pirate TOWERS above Betsy. He
        is dressed in COLORFUL, TATTERED clothes. The pirate LAUGHS. His
        bloated mouth DRIBBLES with pancake crumbs. Betsy STEPS BACK.
        FRIGHTENED. The Pirate removes a DAGGER from his belt. Eyes filled
        with LECHERY, the Pirate moves toward Betsy. She GRABS the skillet.
        THROWING HOT OIL in the Pirate's face. He SCREAMS. Betsy DASHES OUT of
        the kitchen.

<b>        INDIANA
</b>
        has nearly finished SHAVING. He tries to CONVINCE Clare of his
        innocence. She continues to WRITE. IGNORING him.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        You are blowing this Betsy thing all
                        out of proportion...

        Indiana LEANS down. He RINSES his face in a large BUCKET OF WATER. A
        DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! JUST MISSING Indiana. It STICKS into the
        wall. A FEW FEET ABOVE Indy's head. Clare WITNESSES this. SHOCKED.
        UNAWARE of the danger, Indiana RAISES his head out of the bucket. He
        still tries to REASON with Clare.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        It's not as if I have this sleazy
                        reputation...

        Clare is trying to INTERRUPT Indy, trying to POINT OUT the dagger. But
        before she can say a word, Indiana again LEANS into the water bucket.
        ANOTHER DAGGER SHOOTS INTO FRAME! INTO the wall. This time only INCHES
        above Indy's head. Indiana again RAISES his head.

<b>                                        INDIANA

                        admired...

        Clare LEAPS FORWARD. She pushes Indy OUT OF THE WAY, moments before
        another DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! STICKING into the wall! Indy and
        Clare TURN.

        THREE PIRATES stand here. DIRTY. TOOTHLESS. UGLY. SWORDS EXTENDED,
        they MOVE toward Indiana and Clare. Indy's eyes DART to the water
        bucket table. His WHIP and PISTOL rest here. OUT OF REACH. Indy and
        Clare are TRAPPED. The Pirates move CLOSER...

        Suddenly, A LOUD SCREAM. The Pirates LOOK UP. SCRAGGY swings from a
        ROPE above. TOWARD the Pirates. Before the Pirates can react, Scraggy
        CRASHES into them. They TUMBLE to the deck. Scraggy SHOOTS to his
        feet. He tosses a spare SWORD to Indy. Scraggy and Indy begin to
        SWORDFIGBT the Pirates.

        Clare TURNS. DASHING around the corner. To SAFETY. A SUDDEN STOP. Her
        face is buried in the hairy, bare chest of KEZURE, an enormous, bear-
        like PIRATE KING. Kezure HASN'T BATHED in years. He is dressed in
        SEVERAL LAYERS of tattered, colorful clothing, GOLDEN JEWELRY, and
        ANIMAL SKINS. His STRINGY hair is long, tied in a PONYTAIL behind his
        head. A thick, long MOUSTACHE wraps around a large mouth, filled with
        crooked, GOLDEN TEETH. Clare SHRIEKS. Kezure GRABS her around the
        waist. He TOSSES Clare over his shoulder.

        The river boat is overcome with a mixture of ORIENTAL and BLACK
        Pirates. SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS! There is a HEATED BATTLE between the
        crew members and the Pirates. Fists FLYING. Swords CLASHING.

        Using her Brooklyn street smarts, Betsy FIGHTS like a pro. With a
        swift PUNCH and KICK, Betsy DEFEATS one Pirate. She takes his SWORD.
        ANOTHER Pirate comes for Betsy. She EDGES him on.

<b>                                        BETSY

                        wouldn't last ten minutes in
                        Brooklyn.

        The Pirate ATTACKS. He and Betsy begin a HEATED SWORDFIGHT.

        Indiana and Scraggy CONTINUE TO BATTLE the onslaught of sword slinging
        Pirates. Suddenly, Indy is interrupted by Clare's LOUD SCREAM! He
<b>        TURNS.
</b>
<b>        A PIRATE SHIP
</b>
        has APPEARED. BESIDE the river boat. The ship is ANCIENT. OMINOUS.
        COUNTLESS PIRATES are aboard the ship. Armed with GUNS, BOWS AND
        ARROWS and CANNONS.

<b>        EXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK
</b>
        KEZURE, the Pirate King, stands at the edge of the boat. He still
        HOLDS the screaming Clare over his shoulder. From the Pirate ship, the
        Pirates toss a GRAPNEL ROPE to Kezure. The Pirate King GRABS BOLD of
        the rope. Holding TIGHTLY to Clare, Kezure SWINGS from the river boat,
        to the Pirate Ship.

        INDIANA runs through the FIGHTING crew members and Pirates, in an
        effort to SAVE Clare. Suddenly, the SOUND OF CANNON FIRE! The river
        boat ROCKS! HIT by a CANNONBALL! Indy KEEPS his balance. SWORD in
        hand, he DIVES INTO THE WATER.

        Indiana SWIMS across the Zambesi. TOWARD the Pirate ship. The water
        surrounding Indy erupts with COUNTLESS SPRAYS OF BULLETS, CANNONBALLS
        and FLYING ARROWS.

<b>        EXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK
</b>
        The swordfighting crew members manage to keep the many Pirates AT BAY.
        Scraggy EXCHANGES swordplay with a Pirate. The sword is KNOCKED from
        Scraggy's hand. He is DEFENSELESS. The Pirate COMES in for the kill.
        He RAISES HIS SWORD...ready to PLUNGE it into Scraggy's heart... The
        Pirate suddenly PAUSES. A HORRIFIED look on his face. The end of a
        SWORD SHOOTS OUT OF THE PIRATE'S CHEST! A MOMENT PASSES...the sword
        SLIDES BACK INSIDE of the Pirate's chest. The Pirate FALLS to the
        deck. BETSY stands behind him. She holds the BLOODIED SWORD. Scraggy
        gives her a THANKFUL NOD.

<b>        EXT. PIRATE SHIP
</b>
        Indiana has MADE IT ACROSS the Zambesi. He CLIMBS UP the side of the
        Pirate Ship. The Pirates begin to SHOOT at Indy. Indy is HIT. An
        ARROW. In the ARM. He dives to safety in a nearby CANNON COMPARTMENT.

<b>        INT. CANNON COMPARTMENT
</b>
        Indy PULLS the arrow out of his arm. He is suddenly ATTACKED by the
        Pirate Gunner. The two begin to STRUGGLE. FIGHT. CAMERA PANS TO the
        rear of the cannon, moving to a CLOSE UP of the FUSE. The fuse is LIT.
<b>        BURNING.
</b>
        Meanwhile, Indy and the Pirate fight DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE CANNON'S
        OPEN BARREL! Every few seconds, each of their heads MOVES IN FRONT of
        the opening. The fuse continues to BURN. Getting LOWER...LOWER...

<b>        EXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK
</b>
        Clare has been TIED to a mast pole. Kezure STANDS in front of her. As
        his men BATTLE around him, Kezure leans forward. The drooling Pirate
        King sloppily KISSES Clare. Along her NECK. Clare is NAUSEOUS.

<b>        INT. CANNON COMPARTMENT
</b>
        Indy and the Pirate continue to FIGHT. The cannon fuse SPARKS. BURNING
        toward the bottom. The Pirate pushes Indy's head INSIDE OF THE CANNON
        OPENING. The FUSE will BLOW at any second. At the last moment, Indiana
        OVERPOWERS the Pirate. Indy LEAPS to the floor. The Pirate FALLS
        FORWARD. FACE TO FACE WITH THE CANNON OPENING! BOOM! The cannon FIRES!
        Indy's shirt is SPLATTERED with blood. Indiana RUNS to a wooden
        staircase, hurrying up the stairs. To the TOP DECK.

<b>        EXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK

        Kezure kisses the bare shoulder of the STRUGGLING, HELPLESS Clare.
        Indy EMERGES from the cannon compartment. Upon seeing the Pirate King
        ATTACK Clare, Indiana SHOUTS.

        Kezure TURNS. He emits a gravelly laugh and scratches his neck,
        curiously STUDYING Indiana. Indy EXTENDS his sword. The Pirate King
        removes a long, sharp GOLDEN SWORD. They begin to FIGHT. Moving ALONG
        the deck. A FAST PACED, HEATED swordfight.

<b>        EXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK
</b>
        A PIRATE has taken over the boat's WHEEL. He STEERS the river boat OFF
        THE REGULAR PATH. It SPEEDS toward the base of a LARGE, THRASHING
        WATERFALL. The Pirate ship moves ALONGSIDE of the river boat, also
        HEADED for the waterfall. SCRAGGY and BETSY sees the waterfall ahead.
        PANIC fills their eyes. They DASH to the steering wheel. Betsy
        DISTRACTS the Pirate. They begin to SWORDFIGHT. Scraggy TAKES the
        steering wheel. He attaempts to steer the ship AWAY from the
        waterfall.

<b>        EXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK

        Indiana and the Pirate King have climbed to the top of the SHIP'S
        MAST. They battle AMIDST the tangled ropes. SWORDS CLASHING. As the
        two men fight, Indy notices that the Pirate ship is HEADED FOR THE
        WATERFALL. Indiana has a sudden REALIZATION. He sees Scraggy, trying
        to STEER THE RIVER BOAT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. Indy SCREAMS above
        the cannon fire.

        toward the waterfall.

<b>        INDIANA AND KEZURE

        SWING from sail to sail, continuing their SPECTACULAR swordfight.
        CLARE helplessly watches from the deck.

<b>        THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP

        continue to move SIDE BY SIDE. Moving CLOSER...CLOSER...to the
        shattering waterfall.

<b>        SCRAGGY
</b>
        continues to rev the RIVER BOAT'S engine. CHANTING various prayers
        under his breath. In the background, a FEISTY Betsy continues to
        swordfight.

<b>        THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP
</b>
        PENETRATE the waterfall. The two boats are met with an exploding
        shower of POWERFUL WATER! Crew members and Pirates are TOSSED ABOUT
        the deck. Indiana and the Pirate King hold TIGHTLY to the sails, to
        AVOID being thrown into the waters below.

<b>        EXT. RIVER BOAT
</b>
        The aged boat TOSSES. TILTS. SPINS. Nearly CAPSIZING. Boards CREAK and
        MOAN. Ready to BURST. But Scraggy holds TIGHTLY to the steering wheel.
        Keeping the boat AFLOAT.

        The powerful water sends Betsy SOMERSAULTING along the deck. She tries
        to GRAB HOLD of something...anything...that will PREVENT her from
        falling off the boat. Betsy finally CLUTCHES onto something. The ARM
<b>        OF A DEAD PIRATE.
</b>
<b>        THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP
</b>
        are IMMERSED into the waterfall. They DISAPPEAR behind the thrashing
        curtain of water.

<b>        INT. BEHIND THE WATERFALL
</b>
        The Pirates' HIDDEN FORTRESS. An enormous, underground CAVERN.
        Hndreds of BURNING TORCHES cast a devilish glow. The grey rocks of the
        cavern walls stretch UPWARD. Filled with countless, tiny CAVES.
        Various stone artifacts and ancient untensils are SCATTERED throughout
        the cavern. There are several other PIRATES here. ARMED. Waiting for
        the RETURN of the Pirate Ship.

        The River Boat and Pirate Ship ENTER the cave. The rushing waterfall
        THRASHES behind them. The BATTERED and BRUISED River Boat comes to a
        ROUGH stop. SCREECHING along a far wall. The Pirate Ship sails to a
        SMOOTH STOP in the middle of the cavern. Armed with guns, knives and
        swords, the Pirates hurriedly SURROUND the intruding River Boat. They
        take Betsy, Scraggy and the crew members CAPTIVE.

        KEZURE leaps to the Pirate Ship's deck and quickly UNTIES Clare.
        Indiana ATTEMPTS to FOLLOW. He PAUSES. Quickly GRABBING A FEW STICKS
        OF DYNAMITE from the Pirate Ship deck. Kezure begins to LEAD Clare off
        of the ship. His sword at her THROAT. Indiana CALLS OUT.

        Kezure STOPS. He TURNS. Indy WALKS toward Kezure, stopping less than
        TEN FEET from the Pirate King and Clare. Indy's eyes BURN through
        Kezure.

        Kezure LAUGHS. Indiana LIGHTS the dynamite fuses. Kezure STOPS
        laughing...WORRIED for a moment... Then, the Pirate King breaks into a
        wide, DEFIANT SMILE.

        A STANDOFF. Indy DIDN'T EXPECT this. He is suddenly FRIGHTENED.
        PUZZLED. Betsy, Scraggy and Clare STARE at Indy. Waiting for his NEXT
        MOVE...as the dynamite fuse SLOWLY BURNS. Getting CLOSER...CLOSER...to
        the TNT. Kezure seems CALM. Perfectly WILLING TO DIE. Indy gets
        ANOTHER IDEA. He BLURTS it out to Kezure.

        Scraggy and Betsy exchange a SHOCKED glance. Clare is also SURPRISED
        by the news. The TNT fuse nears the end...ready to BLOW AT ANY

        EXTENDS the scroll to Kezure.

<b>        INT. WATER CURTAIN CAVE - THAT NIGHT
</b>
        A group of Pirates sit TOGETHER. DRUNK. They SING one of their ancient
        songs. The GUITAR strumming crew member accompanies them. Indiana and
        Scraggy sit around a BLAZING FIRE with Kezure and several other
        Pirates. Indy, wearing his spectacles, TRANSLATES the scrolls with
        Scraggy. Indiana is PUZZLED. TROUBLED. He LOOKS at Scraggy.

                        There's something here...something
                        that could help us...

        Meanwhile, Betsy and Clare work in ANOTHER SECTION of the cave. Clare
        is doing some ARCHEOLOGICAL WORK, studying the various artifacts and
        utensils. Betsy ASSISTS her. They are surrounded by LEERING, HUNGRY
        EYED PIRATES. The drunken Pirates DON'T take their eyes off of the
        girls. Betsy NOTICES. She POINTS it out to Clare.

        Clare and Betsy exchange a CHUCKLE.

        Meanwhile, Indiana, Scraggy and Kezure WALK through the cavern. Indy
        is LOOKING around. CURIOUS, he turns to Kezure.

        Kezure leads Indiana and Scraggy into a DARK CORNER of the cavern. A
        large, smooth WALL stretches to the ceiling. The wall is filled with
        intricate CRACKS. At the base of the wall, water slowly POURS into the
        cavern. Kezure POINTS to the water.

        CAMERA PULLS BACK. All of the Pirates SLEEP. Their slumbering bodies
        LIE in various positions, throughout the cave. Indiana and Kezure are
        STILL AWAKE. The flickering orange light of the TORCHES illuminates
        the wall in front of them. They AWAIT the lowering tide. Scraggy,
        Betsy and Clare SLEEP on the ground beside them. Kezure POURS two
        glasses of whiskey from a STONE BOTTLE. He gives a GLASS to Indiana.
        Kezure TOASTS.

        Indiana DOWNS his whiskey. A LAUGHING Kezure does the same. Indiana
        NOTICES something. ON the wall. He JUMPS to his feet. CAMERA PANS TO
        THE WALL. The tide is VERY LOW. The entire wall is now VISIBLE. What
        were once simple CRACKS, have become the specific LINES OF A MAP. A
        group of ARROWS leads to an "X" at the BOTTOM CORNER OF THE MAP. A
        FASCINATED Kezure and Indiana STUDY the wall.

        CAMERA PANS FROM Indiana and Kezure, to a DARK CAVE. A FEW FEET away.
        Standing inside, is the figure of the MYSTERIOUS CREW MEMBER. The
        TRAITOR. His face is HIDDEN in the shadows. Again, he RADIOS back to
        Nazis. He WHISPERS in German. CAMERA DOLLIES INTO A CLOSE UP of his
        RADIO MICROPHONE. A RED SWASTIKA adorns the microphone.

<b>        EXT. JUNGLE PLAINS - THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON
</b>
        Scraggy's decrepid MODEL-T TAXI putters across the flat, jungle
        terrain. The HOT SUN shines in the background. The car is completely
        PACKED with people. Ready to BURST. Scraggy DRIVES. Indiana, Clare and
        Betsy are CROWDED in the front seat. Kezure and four Pirates ride in
        the REAR COMPARTMENT. Everyone is UNCOMFORTABLE. CRAMPED. SWEATING.
        Two of Scraggy's crew members STRADDLE the sideboard. Three men sit on
        the ROOF, including the GUITAR PLAYER, who plays a delightful melody.
        Various rusted POTS, PANS and other UTENSILS dangle from the car. This
        creates a CHARMING, JINGLING sound.

        The taxi passes a HERD OF GIRAFFE. The beautiful animals stare in
        BEWILDERMENT at the passing taxi. Suddenly, there is a DISTANT SOUND.
        The same LOW, RUMBLING we heard earlier. The giraffes SCATTER. AFRAID
        of the unnatural sound.

<b>        INT. TAXI

        The bizarre SOUND echoes through the taxi. Indy EXCHANGES a puzzled
        look with the others.

        The sound STOPS. Indiana is BOTHERED. DISTURBED. Kezure LEANS forward.
        He points to a CLUSTERED AREA OF JUNGLE. Nearly a MILE in the
        distance.

        THROUGH THE WINDOW! JUST MISSING everyone. It SHATTERS the passenger
        window.

        A TRIBE OF NATIVE WARRIORS appear on the terrain. There are HUNDREDS.
        SCREAMING in high pitched squeals. Their bodies ADORNED with red and
        white PAINT. The angry warriors RUN TOWARD the taxi. FIRING ARROWS!

        On the Taxi roof, the men DIVE for cover. Arrows WHIZ by their heads.
        Inside, everyone ROLLS UP the windows. The taxi is attacked with a
        SHOWER OF ARROWS. Scraggy FLOORS the gas. The taxi keeps MOVING AHEAD.
        SPEEDING toward the jungle. Indiana GLARES at Kezure.

        Kezure gives a PUZZLED SHRUG.

        The WARRIORS continue to CHASE the Taxi. Getting CLOSER. Firing more
        ARROWS. The taxi SPINS to a stop. Directly in front of a LARGE OPENING
        that leads into the jungle. Everyone POURS OUT of the Taxi. ARROWS fly
        by their heads. They DASH through the opening. Into the JUNGLE. The
        Warriors STOP. OUTSIDE of the opening. They DON'T ENTER. TURNING to
        each other, they begin to LAUGH. VICTORIOUS.

<b>        INT. JUNGLE
</b>
        An almost PERFECT PATH has been cleared through the thick Jungle.
        Indiana and the others RUN through the path. Indy SUDDENLY PAUSES.
        MOTIONING for the others to STOP. A PUZZLED LOOK covers his face.

        One of the Pirates CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. His foot TRIPS A THIN
        STRING that stretches across the path. WHOOSH! A BOOBY TRAPPED PALM
        TREE SWINGS FORWARD! It SLAMS into the Pirate! Like a giant BASEBALL
        BAT! It sends the Pirate FLYING UPWARD. HIGH INTO THE AIR! His body is
        THROWN several feet into the jungle.

        Indiana exchanges a CAUTIOUS look with the others.

        Indiana LEADS everyone. They CREEP through the path. Indy PAUSES.
        CAMERA PANS TO HIS WAIST. A SECTION OF VINE stretches across the path.
        ANOTHER booby trap. Indiana CRAWLS BENEATH THE VINE. He MOTIONS for
        the others to follow. One by one, they CAREFULLY CRAWL beneath the
        vine. The guitar player is LAST. He begins to CRAWL through. He NEARLY
        makes it, when...the top of his guitar HITS THE VINE! The vine SNAPS.
        There is a CREAKING SOUND.

<b>        A GIANT, METAL TRAP, OVER FOUR FEET HIGH, SHOOTS UP FROM THE GROUND! A
</b>        HUMAN TRAP! The GUITAR PLAYER DIVES TO SAFETY! The trap's SHARP METAL
        TEETH SNAP SHUT! The guitar is SNAPPED IN TWO!

        Soon, the path ERUPTS with countless ROWS OF TRAPS. They EJECT from
        the ground. SNAPPING SHUT. One AFTER the other. Everyone begins to
        RUN. The traps SNAP SHUT ONLY A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM! Everyone ROUNDS
        A CORNER... They COME UPON...

        AN ENORMOUS PIT! Over TEN FEET DEEP! Filled with countless layers of
        SCORPIONS! There is NOWHERE TO TURN. NOWHERE TO RUN. The METAL TRAPS
        continue to SHUT BEHIND THEM!

        Indiana removes his SWORD. He slices at A BAMBOO TREE. The traps
        CONTINUE TO SHUT BEHIND HIM. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. Indiana gives A
        FINAL WHACK TO THE TREE. It FALLS. STRETCHING across the pool. Only A
        FEW FEET ABOVE the stinging scorpions. Indiana begins to CLIMB ACROSS.
        Moving HAND OVER HAND. Everyone hurriedly FOLLOWS. The bamboo tree
        CREAKS with their every movement. Their feet DANGLE only INCHES above
        the scorpions. The last Pirate GRABS HOLD of the bamboo tree, just as
        the FINAL METAL TRAP SHUTS! JUST MISSING HIM!

        As the last Pirate makes his way ACROSS the pit, he DROPS a small bag
        of GOLD COINS. The coins REST a few feet below. DIRECTLY ON TOP of the
        scorpions. The Pirate PAUSES. DECIDING whether to climb to safety or
        retrieve the coins. Everyone else has MADE IT across. The GREEDY
        Pirate wants his money. With his left hand, he HOLDS TIGHTLY to the
        bamboo tree. With the other, he REACHES for the coins. His fingers are
        INCHES from the ciins. But he LOSES his grip. He FALLS. INTO THE PIT.
        SURROUNDED by hundreds of scorpions. He STRUGGLES to get out.
        CLIMBING. SWIMMING. But he only manages to SINK. The Pirate's SCREAMS
        die, as his body is ENGULFED by the stinging scorpions.

        Indiana and the others CONTINUE AHEAD. Moving SLOWLY. CAREFULLY.
        Someone's foot STEPS ON A WOODEN TRIGGER. There is another CREAKING
        SOUND. Behind everyone, a large BAMBOO DOOR EJECTS FROM THE GROUND. It
        leads to an UNDERGROUND CAGE. The door CREAKS OPEN. THREE FEROCIOUS
        LIONS LEAP OUT! TEETH BARED. GROWLING. They COME FOR the humans.

        Everyone DASHES FORWARD. RUNNING. The lions are in HOT PURSUIT. FAST.
        The humans don't stand a CHANCE. Suddenly, Clare STOPS. She TURNS.
        FACING the charging lions. Indiana LOOKS BACK. SCREAMING.

        The lions STOP. Inches from Clare. They SURROUND her. Ready to ATTACK.
        Indiana WATCHES. PUZZLED. Clare begins to make bizarre PURRING and
        COOING SOUNDS. The lions PAUSE. They RECOGNIZE the sounds. Clare
        CONTINUES. The lions begin to WARM UP to her. Clare KNEELS. She PETS
        the beasts. The lions SNUGGLE up to Clare. LICKING her face. Indiana
        and the others COME CLOSER. PUZZLED. Clare EXPLAINS.

        Indy TURNS...FACE TO FACE with a grotesque SHRUNKEN HEAD! He STEPS
        BACK. The shrunken head is worn around the neck of a tall, muscular
        TRIBAL CHIEF. Leader of the WARRIORS. Countless NATIVES stand behind
        the chief. A look of ANGER...HATE...covers the Chief's face. Indiana
        gives a HOPEFUL glance to Kezure.

                        No. That is him.

        Indiana ROLLS his eyes. The warriors SURROUND everyone. ARROWS aimed.
        Ready to KILL. The Warriors lead everyone OUT of the path.

        Several GRASS HUTS are scattered throughout this large village.
        Indiana and the others are LED into the village. They PASS the

        Suddenly, a VOICE echoes from inside of the oven. The natives LISTEN.
        Again, the voice SHOUTS from inside. It's SCRAGGY. The natives
        RECOGNIZE the language. They quickly OPEN the oven door. Scraggy is
        SCREAMING in the tribe's tongue. The grille is PULLED out of the oven.
        The natives hurriedly UNTIE the slightly smoked Indiana, Kezure and
        Scraggy.

        Scraggy SHOOTS to his feet. FURIOUS. He begins to SHOUT at the tribal
        CHIEF. The Chief and the villagers are AWESTRUCK by Scraggy's words.
        The nervous Chief ORDERS Clare, Betsy and the others UNTIED. Scraggy
        WHISPERS to Indiana.

        Indy SMILES. Scraggy TURNS and again SHOUTS to the chief. The chief
        OBEYS Scraggy's every word. He LEADS Indy and Scraggy to another area
        of the village. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indiana.

        The chief leads Indy and Scraggy into a LARGE GRASS HUT.

<b>        INT. GRASS HUT

        EMPTY, save for an elaborate MARBLE ALTAR. A dull MIRROR rests on the
        altar. The small mirror is surrounded by a crude, STONE FRAME. The

        Scraggy GIVES the mirror to Indiana.

        The village SLEEPS. QUIET. PEACEFUL. Scraggy's Model-T is PARKED here.
        Several of the crew members and Pirates are SLEEPING in and around the
        car. KEZURE is sprawled on the car's roof. SNORING. It is obvious that
        they have CAMPED here for the evening.

        Suddenly, a SLIGHT TREMOR surges through the village. A soft
        VIBRATION. Cooking utensils RATTLE. Grass huts SHAKE.

<b>        INT. GRASS HUT
</b>
        Indiana SLEEPS here. In a HAMMOCK. The vibration WAKES Indy. As he
        moves to climb out of the hammock, a FIGURE LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM!

        Indiana attempts to PUSH Betsy out of the hammock. She RESISTS. They
        begin to WRESTLE. STRUGGLE. The hammock becomes TANGLED around their
        bodies.

        Clare WALKS BY the hut. She LOOKS inside. To her, it appears that Indy
        and Betsy are in the middle of a PASSIONATE love scene. She emits a
        SHOCKED GASP. Indiana SEES Clare. He CALLS OUT.

        The vibrating INTENSIFIES. The ground begins to RUMBLE. The
        surrounding trees SHAKE. The villagers POUR out of their huts,
        gathering in the middle of town. FRIGHTENED. Indiana and Betsy JOIN
        Scraggy, Clare, Kezure and the others. Betsy is PUZZLED by the

        Indiana and the others stand in the LARGE GRAVEYARD. SHOVELS in hand.
        They have DUG A LARGE HOLE. Pieces of DECAYED BODIES and SKELETONS
        protrude from the surrounding hole. Scraggy STARES at the ghastly

<b>        THE HERD OF WILDEBEEST

        BURSTING through a section of jungle. They arrive on the VAST JUNGLE
        PLAIN. Directly ahead of them, several feet in the distance, is the
        MONGOOBOO VILLAGE. The Wildebeest head STRAIGHT for the village.

<b>        EXT. VILLAGE
</b>
        DESERTED. NO SIGN of human life. Everything TREMBLES with the force of
        a major earthquake. The wildebeest ARRIVE. DESTROYING the village.
        Grass Huts are FLATTENED. The enormous stone oven COLLAPSES. CRUMBLING
        to pieces. Scraggy's Model-T is OVERTURNED.

        With nothing left standing, the wildebeest MOVE ON. The village has
        been completely DEVASTATED. Surrounded with a heavy CLOUD OF DUST.
        CAMERA PANS TO THE GRAVEYARD. Grave markers and tombstones lie BROKEN
        and CRUSHED. Countless HOOFPRINTS cover the flat ground. The dust
        begins to SETTLE. The graveyard ground suddenly BUCKLES. MOVING. A
        HAND shoots out. Indiana CLIMBS OUT of the dirt. He is FOLLOWED by the
        others, who also CLIMB OUT from underground. Everyone is UNHURT. SAFE.
        PROTECTED by the ground above. A skeleton has ATTACHED itself to
        Betsy. REFUSING to let go.

        Scraggy, Indy and a few of the men RUN to the overturned Model-T Taxi.
        They GRAB hold of the car and TURN it back upright.

        Clare LOOKS at the devastated village. Betsy stands beside her,
        STRUGGLING TO ESCAPE from the clutches of the skeleton. Clare looks
        into the DISTANCE. Watching the DEPARTING Wildebeest. She is TROUBLED.

        Suddenly, the same LOW, RUMBLING SOUND from earlier, ECHOES through
        the area. But this time it is LOUD. Nearly DEAFENING. Scraggy LOOKS at
        Indy.

        At that moment, directly behind Scraggy and Indy, the jungle ERUPTS!
        The trees SEPARATE. CRASHING to the ground. Making way for some GIANT
        BEHEMOTH. Scraggy and the others LEAP IN ONE DIRECTION. Indiana LEAPS
<b>        IN ANOTHER.
</b>
<b>        A GIANT TANK

        Over 25 FEET HIGH. It is equipped with THREE LEVELS. On the TOP LEVEL,
        is the tank's swivelling GUN BARREL. ENORMOUS. The size of a CANNON.
        Two giant, BLAZING RED SWASTIKAS adorn both sides of the tank's SECOND

        The tank's large barrel FIRES A SHOT at the running group. The blast
        FLIES OVER THEIR HEADS. JUST MISSING everyone. It BLASTS a row of palm
        trees to smithereens.

        INDIANA is still running from the rampaging rhino. Indy begins to RUN
        IN A CIRCLE. The angry rhino FOLLOWS him. The circle begins to
        TIGHTEN... Becoming SMALLER... SMALLER... Until Indy is nearly running
        ALONGSIDE of the rhino. At the exact moment, Indy GRABS HOLD of the
        rhino. He LEAPS onto the beast. With a bit of careful maneuvering,
        Indiana is RIDING THE RHINOCEROS!

        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others CONTINUE TO RUN. The tank
        is right BEHIND THEM. MOVING FAST. In HOT PURSUIT. The tank FIRES
        ANOTHER SHOT! It SPLATTERS the ground. BESIDE the group. Again, JUST
        MISSING everyone. The group TURNS. RUNNING in ANOTHER DIRECTION. The
        tank FOLLOWS.

        Indiana continues to ride the WILD, BUCKING rhino. He has NO CONTROL
        over the beast. The rhino spots SOMETHING. The TANK. From this angle,
        the tank, with its large protruding gun barrel, resembles a GIANT
        RHINOCEROS. Seeing this, the rhino turns and RUNS TOWARD the tank.
        HEAD ON. Indy holds TIGHTLY.

        Scraggy and the others PAUSE. They see the tank BEHIND THEM. They see
        the rhino AHEAD of them. The group makes QUICK TURN. To the RIGHT.
        They run toward a RAVINE.

        beneath the tank's giant treads, the RHINO TURNS and RUNS OFF.

        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others, have arrived at the foot
        of a tall, several branched TREE. Located at the side of the RAVINE.
        Over the ravine's edge, is a SEVERAL HUNDRED FOOT DROP onto jagged

                        Send help! We need assistance!

        Tyki HELPLESSLY watches in the background. Gutterbuhg LOOKS into the
        periscope. He SEES Indiana. ON the tank. Gutterbuhg hits a RED BUTTON.
        On the CONTROL PANEL.

<b>        EXT. TANK

        COUNTLESS ROWS OF MACHINE GUNS eject from secret slots. All AROUND the
        tank's FIRST LEVEL. The machine guns begin to FIRE. RAPIDLY. WILDLY.
        Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the guns. He CLIMBS to the SECOND LEVEL. But
        the large SWASTIKAS begin to move. OPENING. They are actually HIDDEN
        DOORS. SECRET COMPARTMENTS. Several NAZI SOLDIERS exit the
        compartments. They COME FOR Indiana. He FIGHTS the onslaught of
        soldiers. PUNCHING. WRESTLING.

        The tank, without a driver, begins to wildly SPIN. Going in CIRCLES.

        From the tree, SCRAGGY sees Indy's dillemma. He SHOUTS to the others.

<b>                                        SCRAGGY

        Scraggy begins to CLIMB OUT of the tree. A GUN suddenly MOVES INTO
        FRAME. POINTED at Scraggy's head. Scraggy TURNS. One of his CREW
        MEMBERS holds the gun.

<b>                                        CREW MEMBER

                        All of you. Stay where you are.

        Scraggy and the others FREEZE. Clare makes a REALIZATION. She GLARES
        at the Crew Member.

                        Nazis found us.

        The crew member gives an evil SMILE.

        Indiana continues to FIGHT the Nazis, along the SECOND LEVEL of the
        frenzied tank. Indy has DEFEATED most of the soldiers. Only TWO NAZIS
        remain. They OVERCOME Indy. They push him DOWNWARD. Toward the tank's
        FIRST LEVEL. Toward the rows of FIRING MACHINE GUNS. Indiana STRUGGLES
        to break free. But the powerful Nazis push him CLOSER...CLOSER...to
        the machine guns.

        In the TREE, the crew member keeps his pistol AIMED at Scraggy's head.
        CAMERA PANS UPWARD. Kezure is PERCHED on the top branch. ABOVE
        Scraggy. At the right moment, Kezure LEAPS DOWN. ON TOP of the
        treacherous crew member. Kezure KNOCKS the gun from the crew member's
        hand. BLAM! The gun GOES OFF. A stray bullet STRIKES the tree trunk.
        Kezure PUNCHES the crew member, who LOSES HIS BALANCE and FALLS from
        the tree. Going OVER THE EDGE of the ravine. His body DROPS hundreds
        of feet. CRASHING to the rocks below.

        Kezure SMILES. VICTORIOUS. But the tree suddenly CREAKS. GROANS. A
        CRACK has formed around the trunk, where the bullet STRUCK. The tree
        begins to TILT. Slowly TEETERING over the ravine's edge. Everyone
        PANICS. Betsy SHOUTS.

        Everyone FREEZES. Scared to DEATH. They TIGHTLY GRIP their branches.
        The tree SWAYS. SLOWLY.

        Indiana still FIGHTS the two Nazis. STRUGGLING to keep his body from
        the tank's deadly machine guns. Indy FLIPS one of the Nazis over his
        head. The Nazi falls DIRECTLY IN FRONT of an entire row of machine
        guns. His body does a GROTESQUE DANCE OF DEATH. RIDDLED with bullets.

        Indiana and the other Nazi exchange PUNCHES. Their bodies TUMBLE over
        the rear of the tank. They fall onto a SMALL LEDGE. Above the
        enormous, rotating TANK TREADS. Indy and the Nazi battle to push the
        other OFF THE LEDGE. Indiana PREVAILS. He pushes the Nazi ON TOP of
        the giant treads. The Nazi tries to CLIMB BACK...but his body is
<b>        DRAGGED BENEATH THE TANK. CRUSHED.
</b>
        Indiana turns, seeing Gutterbuhg climb out of a SECRET HATCH. On the
        tank's TOP LEVEL. Gutterbuhg POINTS HIS FINGER at Indy. It rapidly
        FIRES BULLETS. Indy DODGES around the side of the tank. Bullets BOUNCE
        off the metal beside him.

        Meanwhile, Indy's friends sit BREATHLESSLY on the swaying tree.
        Everyone is SILENT. STILL. Kezure suddenly SNEEZES. The tree CREAKS.
        It WAVERS over the ravine's edge. Nearly GOING OVER. But it DOESN'T.
        Everyone CATCHES THEIR BREATH. The tree continues to TEETER.

        Gutterbuhg PURSUES Indiana. Playing CAT AND MOUSE along the top level
        of the tank. Indiana PEERS around a corner. Seeing Gutterbuhg AHEAD.
        Indy grabs hold of the large ROTATING GUN BARREL. Indy LIFTS his feet.
        He SWINGS FORWAFD. RIDING the gun barrel. He SPINS around the tank's
        side and comes up BEHIND the unsuspecting Gutterbuhg. Indy JUMPS the
        Nazi. They begin to FIGHT. Gutterbuhg tries to move his Mechanical arm
        INTO POSITION. To SHOOT Indy.

        The tank continues to LOSE CONTROL. It no longer SPINS in CIRCLES. It
        is headed STRAIGHT TOWARD the tree filled with Indy's friends.

<b>        INT. TANK

        Tyki SITS inside. WATCHING through the periscope. HELPLESS.

<b>        EXT. PLAINS
</b>
        Gutterbuhg and Indiana continue to FIGHT. Suddenly, there is a BUZZING
        SOUND. An AIRPLANE ENGINE. Indiana LOOKS TO THE SKY. A NAZI BIPLANE
        FLIES TOWARD HIM. The biplane DIVES. Moving LOWER. LOWER. Gutterbuhg
        ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY. Indy is TRAPPED. A SITTING DUCK. The biplane
        SWOOPS DOWN. Trying to HIT Indy. He DIVES onto the tank top. Lying
        FLAT. The plane flies DIRECTLY OVER Indy. JUST MISSING him by a FEW
<b>        FEET.
</b>
        Meanwhile, the tank still DRIVES DIRECTLY TOWARD the swaying tree and
        ravine. Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others remain FROZEN.
        STILL. WATCHING the tank come for them. They are FRIGHTENED. HELPLESS.

        Indy and Gutterbuhg have RESUMED their fighting. STANDING on the
        tank's top. The biplane LOOPS in the air. Coming back for ANOTHER
        SHOT. Gutterbuhg LEAPS out of its path. The plane HEADS STRAIGHT for
        Indy. He again DIVES to the tank's top. The biplane SWOOPS DOWN. This
        time AIMING LOWER. As it PASSES Indy, its wheels GRAZE his back. Indy
<b>        CRIES OUT.
</b>
        The tank continues to SPEED TOWD the tree of trapped people. Getting
<b>        CLOSER...CLOSER...
</b>
        His back ACHING, Indy struggles to keep Gutterbuhg's machine gun arm
        from shooting him. The biplane does another midair LOOP. It TURNS and
        HEADS straight for Indy. This time, the plane WON'T MISS. As the
        biplane gets CLOSE... Indy grabs a tight HOLD of Gutterbuhg's
        Mechanical arm. Indy RAISES the arm. AIMING at the biplane. Indy pulls
        the arm's TRIGGER. FIRING a round of shots. The rapid bullets STRIKE
        the plane's belly. The biplane LOSES CONTROL. Its engine COUGHS. DIES.
        The biplane SPINS. Flipping into a NOSEDIVE. Leaving a trail of BLACK
        SMOKE. The biplane HITS the ground. A FLAMING CRASH! SEVERAL FEET from
        the tank.

        Indiana OVERPOWERS Gutterbuhg. With TWO HARD PUNCHES, Indy FLOORS the
        Nazi. Gutterbuhg lies SPRAWLED on the tank's top. UNCONSCIOUS. Indy
        TURNS. He sees that the speeding tank is going to CRASH into the
        treefull of his friends. Indiana LEAPS into the open tank compartment.

<b>        INT. TANK
</b>
        Indiana TAKES the controls. But they are completely ALIEN to him. He
        hears a SQUEAL. TYKI. Behind HIM. Tyki motions to a SPECIFIC CONTROL.
        Indy GRABS HOLD of it.

<b>        EXT. PLAINS
</b>
        The tank SCREECHES. SPINNING TO A STOP. INCHES from the swaying tree.
        Scraggy, Clare, Betsy, Kezure and the others, emit a UNIFIED SIGH OF
        RELIEF. But the tree suddenly CRACKS. It TILTS. FALLING OVER THE
        RAVINE EDGE! Everyone SCREAMS!

        There is the sudden CRACK OF A WHIP! The whip WRAPS ITSELF around the
        trunk of the tree. Indiana HOLDS the opposite end. He PULLS with all
        of his strength. HOLDING the tree in place. He PREVENTS the tree from
        FALLING into the ravine. Indy SHOUTS to his friends. Through GRITTED
<b>        TEETH.
</b>
<b>                                        INDIANA

        Everyone begins to LEAP from the tree. To the GROUND. Indy CONTINUES
        to hold the tree in place. Muscles BULGING. Sweat POURING. Veins
        POPPING. Soon, everyone is back on the GROUND. SAFE. Indy RETRIEVES
        his whip. The tree TILTS. FALLING over the ravine edge. The tree
        CRASHES to the rocks below. SPLINTERING into a million pieces.

        On the top level of the tank, Gutterbuhg STIRS. WAKES. But Indiana is
        UPON HIM. Using a rope, Indy TIES UP Gutterbuhg. He removes the AMMO
        CARTRIDGE from the Nazi's mechanical arm. EMPTYING the bullets onto
        the ground. Indiana PUSHES Gutterbuhg INSIDE THE TANK.

        Tyki CRAWLS out of the tank. He SEES Clare. TEARS of happiness fill
        his eyes. He RUNS to Clare. The two exchange a WARM EMBRACE. Tyki SEES
        Scraggy. They shake hands and begin an EXCITED CONVERSATION. Like two
<b>        OLD FRIENDS.

        Gutterbuhg GROWLS. He SPEAKS German into the microphone. The voice of
        LIEUT. MEPHISTO answers. Echoing over the SPEAKERS. Indy GRABS the
        microphone. INTERRUPTING.

        CAMERA PULLS BACK. Mephisto is standing beside a long ROW OF TENTS.
        Housing many TROOPS. Several JEEPS are parked in the background. All
        mounted with RECOILEST CANNONS. 5 CANVAS TRUCKS are also here. Filled
        with more TROOPS, CANNONS and AMMUNITION. The Nazis have assembled an

        DROPS the microphone. Suddenly WORRIED. He HURRIES out of the tank.
        Gutterbuhg stays BEHIND. LAUGHING.

        Indiana HURRIES to Tyki and the others. Indy shoots an IMPATIENT

                        Ask him if he knows the way to the

                        is somewhere over there.

        Indy TURNs to the direction where Scraggy points. Several miles away,
        we see COUNTLESS ROWS OF MOUNTAINS. Thick layers of CLOUDS surround
        the mountains. Indiana SIGHS.

        Betsy GIVES the mirror to Tyki. His eyes WIDEN. In AWE. Tyki
        RECOGNIZES the mirror. He excitedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who
        TRANSLATES for Indiana.

        Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The energetic pygmy PLACES the mirror against an
        upright stone. Tyki ADJUSTS the mirror, until it FACES the distant
        mountains. Tyki emits a high pitched GIGGLE. POINTING to the mirror.
        Everyone GATHERS around the mirror. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS.

        The mirror reflects the CLOUDS above the mountains. But above one
        SPECIFIC MOUNTAIN, we see the image of a CITY REFLECTED ON THE CLOUDS!

        Indiana TURNS away from the mirror, looking at the SPECIFIC MOONTAIN.
        But the city is ONLY REFLECTED IN THE MAGICAL MIRROR! Clare SMILES at

</b>                        Dr. Clarke says that you're not
                        really in love with me. You're just
                        trying to prove that you can still
                        attract younger women. You're
                        terrified of getting old.

<b>                                        BETSY
</b>                        That's what I told her. I told her
                        that you really did love me.

<b>                                        INDIANA

                        You mean... She was right?...

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        No... I mean Yes... I mean...

        Indy TURNS, seeing Clare GLARING at him. Indy SIGHS. PAUSES. He gives
        Betsy a TENDER, HONEST look.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        No, Betsy. I don't love you.

</b>                                (tears fill her eyes)
                        That's the first time you ever said
                        it!

        Betsy begins CRYING. Into Clare's ARMS. Indiana SHAKES his head. Clare
        COMFORTS Betsy.

<b>                                        CLARE
</b>                        There. There. He's a very disturbed
                        man.

        Indiana SIGHS. He TURNS. FACE to FACE with a GRINNING and NODDING
        Gutterbuhg.

        Kezure has made his DECISION. Scraggy WAITS. TERRIFIED. Kezure RAISES
        his knife. TOWARD Scraggy's face.

<b>                                        KEZURE
</b>                        Your eyes. They are a striking deep
                        blue.

        Scraggy COVERS his face. Kezure ATTACKS him. Trying to CUT OUT
        Scraggy's eyes. A FIGHT begins. The crew members VS. the Pirates.
        Indiana TURNS, away from the controls. He BREAKS UP the fight.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                                (angry)
                        Enough. We're in this together. If
                        we start fighting among ourselves...
                        we'll never get out alive.

        The men CALM DOWN. CATCHING their breath. Kezure PUTS AWAY his knife.
        He GLARES at Scraggy.

<b>                                        KEZURE

<b>        EXT. MOUNTAIN
</b>
        The tank, without a driver, begins to SWERVE OFF THE MOUNTAIN ROAD.

<b>        INT. TANK
</b>
        Clare NOTICES the tank going over the mountain. She SCREAMS.

<b>                                        CLARE
</b>                        Doctor Jones!!!

        Indy TURNS. LEAPING back to the controls. He hurriedly STEERS the tank
        back onto the mountain path. Saving it at the LAST MOMENT. Everyone
        CATCHES their breath. Indiana STEPS on the gas, continuing AHEAD.

<b>                                                                        CUT TO:
</b>
<b>        EXT. MOUNTAIN - A FEW HOURS LATER
</b>
        The tank has nearly made it to the TOP of the mountain. Trekking
        through a NARROW, ROCKY RAVINE. The tank rolls to a STOP. The top
        hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indiana, Scraggy and Tyki POP OUT. Tyki suddenly
        points to the MOUNTAIN TOP, which is cloaked in thick LAYERS OF
        CLOUDS. Tyki's eyes fill with JOYOUS TEARS. He begins to SHOUT. His
        voice SQUEALS with EXCITEMENT. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indy.

<b>                                        SCRAGGY
</b>                        He say that two miles ahead...we
                        will find his home.

        Indiana SMILES. EXCITED by the prospects. TOUCHED by Tyki's reaction.
        Indy looks to the FOOT of the mountain. Several miles BELOW.

<b>        THE NAZI FORCES
</b>
        have ARRIVED! They are still at least TWO HOURS from reaching Indiana
        and the others. The massive army MOVES FAST. They begin to DRIVE along
        the mountain path. FOLLOWING Indiana. In HOT PURSUIT.

        Indy PAUSES. WORRIED. THINKING. He LOOKS at the surrounding ROCKY
        WALLS, then to the tank's enormous GUN BARREL. An IDEA. He HURRIES
        back inside of the tank. Scraggy and Tyki FOLLOW. CLOSING the hatch
        above them.

<b>        INT. TANK
</b>
        Indy LOOKS at the tank's control panel. A PUZZLEMENT. He LOOKS at
        Gutterbuhg.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        How do I work the big gun?

        Gutterbuhg SMILES. He REFUSES to answer. Indy has NO TIME for games.
        He LOOKS at Kezure.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Want your souvenir?
                                (grabs Gutterbuhg's left
                                arm)
                        Start with his good arm.

        Kezure SMILES and removes his LONG KNIFE. He moves it Gutterbuhg's
        NECK. The snivelling Nazi CRIES OUT.

<b>                                        GUTTERBUHG
</b>                        W-W-Wait!... Please!...

        Indy NODS to Kezure. The Pirate King moves his KNIFE. Gutterbuhg
        hurriedly POINTS to two switches on the control panel.

<b>                                        GUTTERBUHG
</b>                        There. That is what you want.

        Indy NODS. He TURNS to the switches.

<b>        EXT. RAVINE
</b>
        CLOSE-UP: The tank's large gun barrel SWIVELS. Pointing UPWARD. To the
        ROCKS above. The gun FIRES A SHOT. It swivels a FEW FEET. Then FIRES
        ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. A RUMBLING SOUND echoes through the area.

<b>        INT. TANK
</b>
        Indy HITS the gas.

<b>        EXT. RAVINE
</b>
        The tank SHOOTS forward. SPEEDING ahead. An AVALANCHE BEGINS! JUST
        MISSING the tank. Several pounds of ROCKS and DEBRIS fall from above.
        The rocks create A THICK WALL. BLOCKING the mountain path.

        The tank CONTINUES along the twisting, narrow mountain path. Moving
        further and further UPWARD. The tank DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK CLOUDS
        that surround the mountain.

<b>        INT. TANK
</b>
        Indiana LOOKS through the persiscope. His view BLINDED by the clouds.

<b>        EXT. MOUNTAIN
</b>
        The tank is a LARGE, GREY BLUR through the clouds. Several DARK,
        BULKING FIGURES APPEAR! They CLIMB along the ravine sides and tops.
        The mysterious figures SURROUND the tank. All are holding ENORMOUS
        BOULDERS over their heads. AIMED at the tank.

<b>        INT. TANK
</b>
        Indy EASES up on the gas. The tank SLOWS. Suddenly, there is a LOUD
        CRASH! The tank is HIT. RATTLING. SHAKING. Everyone is TOSSED. Save
        for Indy, who STAYS at the controls. He continues to GUIDE the tank
        FORWARD. There is another CRASH. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.

<b>        EXT. MOUNTAIN
</b>
        The dark figures SHOWER the tank with heavy boulders. The tank's gun
        barrel SNAPS IN TWO. Headlights SMASH. Its body becomes DENTED.
<b>        CRACKED.
</b>
<b>        INT. TANK
</b>
        Indiana is TOUGH. PERSISTENT. He continues to move the jolting tank
        FORWARD. As the surrounding walls CAVE IN. SHATTER. Everyone PANICS.
<b>        SCREAMING.
</b>
<b>        EXT. MOUNTAIN
</b>
        The injured, wobbling tank moves OUT OF THE CLOUDS. Arriving around
        the corner from the MOUNTAIN TOP. The countless dark figures continue
        to FOLLOW the tank. SCURRYING along the ravine sides and tops. The
        figures EMERGE from the clouds. For the first time, they are VISIBLE.
        And we see that the figures are TALL... HAIRY... MUSCULAR... GORILLAS!
        They CONTINUE to assault the tank with boulders.

<b>        INT. TANK
</b>
        Indiana still attempts to move the tank FORWARD. But the engine begins
        to COUGH. SPUTTER. And DIES.

<b>        EXT. MOUNTAIN
</b>
        The tank COMES TO A SUDDEN STOP. One of the Gorillas emits a BIGS
        PITCHED SHRIEK. COMMUNICATING with the others. The others PAUSE. They
        STOP the attack. The Gorillas APPROACH the tank. SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY.
        The apes REACH OUT. TOUCHING the tank's wrecked body. A few of the
        apes begin to CLIMB onto the tank.

        The tank's top hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indy's HEAD pops out. TWO HAIRY ARMS
        REACH INTO FRAME AND GRAB INDIANA! An enormous Gorilla pulls Indy OUT
        OF THE HATCH! The ape TOSSES INDY OFF SCREEN!

        Indiana FLIES INTO THE AIR! He LANDS IN THE ARMS of another Gorilla.
        The ape TAKES Indy's WHIP and THROWS him to another Gorilla, who takes
        Indy's HAT. The Gorilla TOSSES Indy to another ape, who tears off
        Indy's LEATHER JACKET. The helpless Indy is THROWN to yet another
        Gorilla. The angry ape RAISES Indy over his head. The Gorilla prepares
        to THROW INDIANA OFF OF THE MOUNTAIN'S EDGE!

        Tyki's VOICE ERUPTS FROM OFF SCREEN. The Gorilla PAUSES, suspending
        Indiana HIGH IN THE AIR. The Gorilla TURNS to Tyki. The pygmy STANDS
        on the tank. He SHOUTS AN ORDER to the Gorilla. The ape NODS.
        UNDERSTANDING. He KNOWS Tyki. The Gorilla gently PLACES Indy back on
        the ground. Indiana ADJUSTS what remains of his clothing. He turns,
        seeing A GROUP OF GORILLAS. HUDDLED together. The Gorillas SEPARATE.
        They have DRESSED one of the apes in INDIANA'S HAT, LEATHER JACKET AND
        WHIP! The ape begins to SNAP THE WHIP, almost as if he were IMITATING
        Indy.

        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the others have CLIMBED OUT of the tank.
        Upon seeing the Gorilla DRESSED as Indy, they BURST INTO LAUGHTER. A
        very ANGRY Indiana growls at Tyki.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                                (pointing to Gorilla)
                        Tell him to take off my stuff!

        Through laughter, Scraggy TRANSLATES for Tyki. The pygmy SHOUTS an
        order to the Gorilla. The ape REMOVES the hat and leather jacket,
        RELUCTANTLY giving them back to a grumbling Indiana.

        Tyki continues to SHOOT orders to the other Gorillas. The pygmy
        suddenly appears STRONG. AUTHORITATIVE. He obviously has POWER over
        the beasts. The Gorillas GATHER together. They MOVE TOWARD the people.
        The apes GENTLY take the hands of the various humans. It is a WARM,
        ENCHANTING sight, as the friendly Gorillas LEAD the humans forward.
        Clare, using her Gorilla MOTIONS and SOUNDS, communicates with the
        beasts. The group moves AROUND A TWISTING CORNER OF THE PATH. Toward
        the MOUNTAIN TOP.

<b>        AROUND THE CORNER
</b>
        Indiana and the others are met with an AWESOME SIGHT! Indy STOPS. His
        mouth DROPS OPEN. Clare is equally ASTOUNDED. Betsy and the others
        STARE AHEAD. In total WONDERMENT. Even Gutterbuhg is AMAZED. The SOUND
<b>        TRACK MUSIC EXPLODES INTO A THUNDERING CRESCENDO!
</b>
<b>        THE LOST CITY OF SUN WU-KUNG
</b>
        LIES AHEAD of the group. A SPECTACULAR SIGHT! A city whose every
        building and tower is cast in SOLID GOLD! SPARKLING! GLISTENING! A
        HEAVENLY place. The City is protected by a deep MOAT. The fins of
        several SHARKS move through the moat waters. A THICK STONE WALL
        surrounds the city. A large, golden DRAWBRIDGE is built into the wall.
        PASSAGEWAY into the city.

        A tremendous TOWER stretches above the city walls. The GUARD, a pygmy
        similiar to Tyki, is POSTED in the tower. The guard SPOTS Tyki,
        approaching the city walls. The guard's EYES LIGHT. He SMILES. The
        guard CRIES OUT! SHOUTING to everyone inside of the City. He continues
        to REPEAT a certain phrase.

        Scraggy TRANSLATES the guard's words for Indiana.

<b>                                        SCRAGGY
</b>                        He say... "Our Prince has returned
                        home".

        Indiana SMILES. Soon, the beautiful sound of COUNTLESS RINGING BELLS
        is heard, welcoming Tyki home. Eyes WATERING, a proud Tyki and the
        Gorillas LEAD everyone to the foot of the City Walls. The enormous
        drawbridge begins to LOWER. A STUNNING SHAFT OF GOLDEN LIGHT escapes
        from the opening. As the drawbridge continues to lower, the shaft of
        light becomes WIDER. BRIGHTER. It ILLUMINATES the faces of Indy and
        the others. When the drawbridge is completely LOWERED, everyone is LED
        INTO THE CITY. Their bodies SILHOUETTED against the warm glowing
        light.

<b>        INT. CITY
</b>
        WE ENTER with Indy and the others. The city is BURSTING with the
        bright colors of various VEGETABLE and FRUIT GARDENS, and various
        other EXOTIC PLANT LIFE. Luscious GREEN GRASS and CRYSTAL CLEAR LAKES
        surround many of the homes. The earthen streets are literally PAVED
        WITH GOLD. The men and women of the City are members of Tyki's RACE.
        ORIENTAL PYGMIES. There is a PEACEFUL, JOYOUS quality about them. They
        RUSH toward Tyki. EMBRACING him. SHOWERING him with kisses. WELCOMING
        him home.

        Indiana and the others are in AWE of this new world. Gutterbuhg WALKS
        with them. CAMERA PANS to his HANDS. He struggles to UNTIE his
        bindings.

        Kezure SPOTS something. A small, SOLID GOLD GARDEN TOOL. Lying in a
        VEGETABLE GARDEN. Kezure's eyes fill with GREED. He moves to STEAL the
        can. Kezure GRABS the tool and begins to HIDE it. BENEATH his cloak. A
        LARGE GORILLA'S HAND GRABS Kezure's arm. TOWERING over the Pirate
        king, the Gorilla WAVES his finger at Kezure. A WARNING. NO STEALING.
        The nervous Kezure NODS. He PLACES the garden tool back on the ground.

        Meanwhile, Indy and the others are led to an elaborate PALACE. They
        ascend the several GOLDEN STAIRS, toward the entrance. The palace
        doors OPEN. An OLDER MAN steps outside. He is BOHBALA. The City's
        RULER. A few PALACE GUARDS stand beside him. Bohbala RAISES his arms
        over the crowd. Pygmies and Gorillas DROP TO THEIR KNEES. In REVERNCE.

        Tyki RUNS to Bohbala. They EMBRACE. TEARS OF JOY fill their eyes.
        Bohbala WIPES away his tears. He gives a WARM SMILE to Indiana and the
        others. He SPEAKS. SOFTLY. In a WISE voice. Scraggy TRANSLATES for the
        others.

<b>                                        SCRAGGY
</b>                        He thank us...for returning his son.

        Indiana and the others SMILE. Betsy WHIPSERS to Indy.

<b>                                        BETSY
</b>                        If the little guy's pushin' 200
                        years?... How old's his Father?

        Indy motions for Betsy to "Shhh". Bohbala continues to SPEAK. Scraggy
<b>        TRANSLATES.
</b>
<b>                                        SCRAGGY
</b>                        His name "Bohbala". He is Ruler of
                        City, faithful servant of his Lord
                        and Master... Sun Wu-Kung.
                                (pause, smile)
                        He welcome us to stay. As long as we
                        wish.

        Indiana exchanges a HOPEFUL glance with Clare. As Bohbala CONTINUES to
        speak, CAMERA PANS TO GUTTERBUHG. The Nazi has successfully UNTIED his
        bindings. FREE. While the others listen to Bohbala, Gutterbuhg REMOVES
        ONE SPARE BULLET FROM HIS MOUTH. He slyly INSERTS the bullet into his
        mechanical arm.

        Indiana is TOO CONCERNED with Bohbala to notice Gutterbuhg.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                                (anxious, to Scraggy)
                        Ask him where we may find the burial
                        place...or the remains...of Sun Wu-
                        Kung...

        Scraggy TURNS to ask Bohbala. But his question is INTERRUPTED by
        Gutterbuhg's MECHANICAL ARM. It EXTENDS INTO FRAME! Its finger POINTED
        AT INDIANA! Everyone STARES. SHOCKED. But the bizarre sight greatly
        AMUSES Bohbala. He begins to LAUGH. He REACHES OUT and PUSHES
        Gutterbuhg's finger away. But the machine gun GOES OFF! FIRING!
        Bohbala is HIT! In the CHEST. He FALLS. Tyki KNEELS, cradling
        Bohbala's head in his arms. Tyki CALLS his Father's name. It is
        FUTILE. Bohbala is DEAD.

        The crowd of villagers STARE. CONFUSED. They are unaccustomed to
<b>        VIOLENCE.
</b>
        Indiana CLUTCHES Gutterbuhg by the throat.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Bastard...

        Indiana pulls back his fist to PUNCH the Nazi. But Indy is STOPPED by
        the PALACE GUARDS. They move their SWORDS to his throat. Indy is
        suddenly PUZZLED. The VILLAGERS FALL TO THEIR KNEES. BOWING to
        Gutterbuhg. A distraught Tyki hurriedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who
        translates for Indy.

<b>                                        SCRAGGY
</b>                        It is written... If ruler is

                        possess that power...
                                (points to Gutterbuhg)
                        ...shall become ruler!

        Gutterbuhg's eyes fill with a sadistic THRILL. He RAISES his
        MECHANICAL ARM. In a "Heil Hitler" POSE. The entire City IMITATES the
        Nazi. RAISING their right arms. CHEERING. HAILING their new leader.

        Indiana is HORRIFIED by the scene. Tyki is UPSET. SCREAMING. He knows
        that Gutterbuhg is truly EVIL! But NONE of the villagers listen.
        Indiana LOOKS to his SHOCKED friends.

        Indy GLARES at Gutterbuhg. Clare and Betsy exchange a FRIGHTENED
        glance.

<b>        INT. PALACE - RULER'S CHAMBER
</b>
        A beautiful, expansive chamber, filled with TAPESTRIES and ARTWORK.
        Gutterbuhg sits in an elaborate GOLDEN THRONE. He has donned a
        ghoulish NEW OUTFIT. The robes of BOHBALA, the dead ruler. Gutterbuhg
        is being ATTENDED upon by several villagers, who bring him countless
        PLATES OF FOOD. He is surrounded by SEVERAL WOMEN, who patiently wait
        for his orders. Gutterbuhg GOBBLES down the variety of food and wine.
<b>        DROOLING. SLOBBERING.
</b>
        Scraggy KNEELS before the Nazi. Gutterbuhg USES Indiana's WHIP as a
        LEASH. It is TIED around Scraggy's neck and HELD by the Nazi.
        Gutterbuhg PULLS the leash. HARD. Nearly STRANGLING Scraggy. His mouth
        FILLED WITH FOOD, Gutterbuhg SCREAMS at Scraggy.

<b>                                        GUTTERBUHG

        Scraggy TRANSLATES for the guards.

<b>        INT. DUNGEON
</b>
        DARK. MUSTY. Surrounded with moss covered STONE WALLS. Located BENEATH
        the Palace. Indy and the others are LOCKED inside. Everyone is SILENT.
        STARING. WAITING. Clare CONSOLES a tearful, despondent Tyki. The
        dungeon gate OPENS. The two Guards ENTER. They DRAG Indiana out of the
        dungeon. Betsy CALLS OUT to Indy. Trying to FOLLOW. But the guards
        SLAM the wooden door in Betsy's face. She peers through the small
<b>        BARRED WINDOW. WORRIED. UPSET.
</b>
<b>        INT. PALACE
</b>
        Indiana is LED into the Ruler's Chamber. Indy SEES Scraggy, tied to a
        leash. An angry, VENGEFUL look covers Indy's face. He TURNS to
        Gutterbuhg. The Nazi, still STUFFING his face with food, pulls TIGHTLY
        on Scraggy's leash.

        Indy's eyes BURN. Gutterbuhg GULPS down a glass of wine. Liquid
        SPITTLES from the sides of his mouth. He LOOKS at Indy.

        Gutterbuhg NODS. He TAKES another bite of food, shooting a GLOWERING
        look to Indiana.

<b>                                        GUTTERBUHG

        Gutterbuhg goes back to his FOOD. Scraggy exchanges a WORRIED GLANCE
        with Indiana.

        TRAVELLING along the narrow mountain path. They are more than HALFWAY
        up the mountain. LIEUT. MEPHISTO rides in the FRONT JEEP. He LOOKS to

</b>
<b>        THE LOST CITY - COLISEUM
</b>
        An enormous STONE ARENA. Located in the CENTER of the City. It
        resembles the ROMAN COLISEUM in size and structure. The coliseum's top
        walls are SURROUNDED by countless, large METAL BELLS. The bells are
        RINGING. They are the same bells we heard earlier...but they now sound
        EERIE... THREATENING. The many seats are FILLED with members of the
        village. All GATHERED for a special event.

        Gutterbuhg sits in the elaborate RULER'S BOX. It is covered with a
        protective, GOLDEN GRATING. The box is located directly above the
        earthen PLAYING FIELD. Indy's WHIP is still tied around Scraggy's
        neck, who kneels at Gutterbuhg's FEET.

        TWO GUARDS lead a shirtless INDIANA JONES onto the playing field. They
        bring Indy to a STEEL CAGE, located directly below Gutterbuhg's box.
        Inside of the cage, are TWO ENORMOUS BUFFALO. ANGRY. RESTLESS.

        Betsy, Clare, Tyki, Kezure, the remaining Pirates and Crew members,
        all helplessly watch from inside of a LARGE METAL CAGE. The cage is
        SUSPENDED in the air... DANGLING over a deep pit. It is filled with
<b>        COUNTLESS MANEATING TIGERS.
</b>
        Indy is LED into the cage. BETWEEN the two buffalo. The guards GRABS
        HOLD of Indiana. They TIE one of his arms, and one of his legs, to
        EACH SIDW of the buffalo. Preparing to DRAW and QUARTER Indiana.

        A DELIGHTED Gutterbuhg PEERS DOWN at Indiana.

<b>                                        GUTTERBUHG

                        How long will you be able to ride...
                        before they TEAR YOU IN TWO?

        Indy LOOKS at Scraggy, who is very FRIGHTENED.

<b>                                        GUTTERBUHG
</b>                        Goodbye, Doctor Jones.

        Gutterbuhg TURNS to the guards. Ready to give them the ORDER...to OPEN
        THE CAGE and SET THE BUFFALO FREE! Indy suddenly SCREAMS.

<b>                                        INDIANA
</b>                        Heil Hitler!

        Upon hearing the words, Gutterbuhg STANDS. Like a ROBOT. He RAISES his
        mechanical arm in a "Heil Hitler" POSE.

<b>                                        GUTTERBUHG
</b>                        Heil Hitler!

        The FINGERS of Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm get CAUGHT IN THE METAL
        GRATING ABOVE HIS HEAD! Gutterbuhg TRIES TO REMOVE his fingers. NO
        GOOD. STUCK. Gutterbuhg PULLS. HARD. His mechanical arm is RIPPED FROM
        ITS SOCKET! It DANGLES from the grating.

        The crowd WATCHES. PUZZLED. SHOCKED.

        Scraggy THINKS FAST. He LEAPS to his feet and GRABS the arm. He TEARS
        IT OUT of the grating. Scraggy HOLDS the arm above his head. Now it is
        HE who possesses the POWER! The crowd CHEERS Scraggy! Their NEW RULER!

        Gutterbuhg STEPS BACK. Suddenly FRIGHTENED. Scraggy ORDERS the guards
        to FREE Indiana. The guards hurriedly UNTIE Indy from the buffalo.
        Gutterbuhg TURNS. RUNNING out of the Coliseum. Scraggy SCREAMS to the
        people, motioning for them to FOLLOW Gutterbuhg. Several people LEAP
        from their seats. CHASING the Nazi.

<b>        EXT. COLISEUM
</b>
        Gutterbuhg DASHES OUT! A CROWD OF VILLAGERS follow him. In HOT
        PURSUIT. Gutterbuhg RUNS toward the city gates. He RUNS through.
        ESCAPING the City. The crowd PAUSES. STOPPING. They'll go NO FURTHER.
        They SCREAM and SHOUT at the departing Gutterbuhg, who disappears INTO
<b>        THE MOUNTAINS.
</b>
<b>        INT. COLISEUM
</b>
        Indiana REJOINS his friends on the playing field. They have been FREED
        from the cage. Scraggy gives the WHIP to Indy. Indy is IMPATIENT.
        WORRIED. He LOOKS at everyone.

        Scraggy gives Gutterbuhg's MECAHNICAL ARM to Tyki. The pygmy NODS. He
        UNDERSTANDS. Tyki RAISES THE ARM TOWARD THE PEOPLE. They CHEER Tyki,
        their rightful ruler. Tyki, PULLS BACK and THROWS the mechanical arm.
        HIGH INTO THE AIR! It SOARS several feet! FLYING OVER the coliseum
        walls.

<b>        EXT. CITY
</b>
        The arm flies THROUGH the air... It lands into the MOAT! The arm is
        ATTACKED by a horde of hungry sharks. They TEAR it to pieces.

<b>                                                                        CUT TO:

<b>        EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH
</b>
        The Nazis have arrived at the section of path that is BLOCKED by the
        AVALANCHE. Their other VEHICLES and TROOPS have pulled back. A FEW
        HUNDRED FEET from the AVALANCHE. SEVERAL STICKS OF DYNAMITE have been
        placed beneath the avalanche. The T.N.T. is connected to a LONG FUSE,
        that extends along the path. LIEUT. MEPHISTO stands at the fuse's end.
        He STRIKES a match. Preparing to LIGHT THE FUSE. The match flare is
        INCHES from the fuse... Mephisto is INTERRUPTED by a FAMILIAR VOICE.
        It is GUTTERBUHG. Mephisto BLOWS OUT the match.

        A SOAKING WET Sgt. Gutterbuhg SLIDES down the edge of the ravine. He
        still wears the COLORFUL, ELABORATE ROBES of Bohbala. Mephisto is
        PUZZLED by Gutterbuhg's BIZARRE APPEARANCE. Gutterbuhg STOPS in front
        of Mephisto. Gutterbuhg ATTEMPTS a "Heil, Hitler"... but suddenly
        realizes that his mechanical arm is GONE. Gutterbuhg DRIPS WATER all
        over Mephisto, who is DISGUSTED by the appearance of his officer. He
        SLAPS Gutterbuhg.

<b>                                        MEPHISTO

                        Idiot!... Why are you dressed like
                        that!... Where is your uniform?...

        Before he can answer, Gutterbuhg is SHOVED AWAY by the disgusted
        Mephisto, who ATTEMPTS to LIGHT the fuse. But his matches are USELESS.
        Soaked with WATER. Furious, Mephisto SLAPS Gutterbuhg, ordering him to
        fetch something. The snivelling Gutterbuhg nods and bows, SCURRYING
        away. He RUNS into the rear of A CANVAS TRUCK.

<b>        INT. TRUCK
</b>
        Filled with several crates of DYNAMITE and SUPPLIES. Gutterbuhg DASHES
        inside. Toward a SILVER, METALLIC BRIEFCASE that rests in the rear of
        the truck. Gutterbuhg's greasy fingers OPEN the briefcase.

        Inside, encased in black velvet, are TWO RECTANGULAR COMPARTMENTS. One
        of the compartments is EMPTY. The other houses another MECHANICAL ARM.
        Gutterbuhg quickly ATTACHES the arm to the stub of his shoulder and
<b>        RUNS BACK OUTSIDE.
</b>
<b>        EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH
</b>
        Gutterbuhg REJOINS Mephisto and EXTENDS his new mechanical arm TOWARD
        THE FUSE. Gutterbuhg POINTS his finger. He SQUEEZES A LEVER, located
        on the palm of the mechanical arm. A BRIGHT, JAGGED LINE OF ELECTRICAL
        CURRENT shoots from the arm's finger! The electricity LIGHTS the fuse.
        It BURNS. Moving TOWARD the dynamite. Gutterbuhg and Mephisto HIDE
        behind a rock. There is a LOUD EXPLOSION. Rocks and debris FLY THROUGH
        THE AIR. The path is CLEARED.

<b>        INT. CITY
</b>
        The SOUND OF THE EXPLOSION echoes through the City. SHAKING the city
        walls. The Nazis are CLOSE.

        Indiana STANDS in the city square. He has ASSEMBLED everyone for the
        battle. Tyki and the pygmies are armed with BOWS and ARROWS, SPEARS
        and BLOW PIPES. Kezure and the Pirates hold their SWORDS. Scraggy's
        men carry REVOLVERS and DAGGERS. Clare and Betsy STAND with several
        Gorillas. Tyki WHISPERS to Scraggy, who TRANSLATES for Indiana.

                        two years...he was the Quarterback.
                        Star of the team. And you know why?...
                                (Music SOARS, as does
                                Indy's voice)
                        'Cause that little kid had somethin'

<b>                        JUST HOW TOUGH THE LITTLE GUYS ARE!
</b>
        Everyone breaks into a loud CHEER. Ready to FIGHT. The sound track
        music SOARS. Indiana RAISES HIS SWORD. He TURNS and RUNS toward the
        DRAWBRIDGE. The people FOLLOW, as Indy LEADS THEM INTO BATTLE!

<b>        EXT. CITY
</b>
        Indiana, armed with a shield, sword and pistol, LEADS his troops
        forward. The Nazis are APPROACHING. LIEUT. MEPHISTO rides in the front
        jeep, which is mounted with a large RECOILIST MACHINE GUN. The entire
        Nazi army is BEHIND HIM. Mephisto's jeep begins to CROSS the
        drawbridge. Moving TOWARD Indiana and the others. The recoilist
        machine gunner OPENS FIRE on Indy and the troops.

        Bullets BOUNCE from Indy's shield. Several of the pygmies are HIT.
        FALLING to the drawbridge. An angry pygmy THROWS his spear. It HITS
        the machine gunner. THROUGH the heart.

        The jeep continues to DRIVE FORWARD. HEADED straight for Indiana, who
        LEAPS ONTO the jeep's hood. Indy's troops SPLIT INTO GROUPS. Dashing
        around the speeding jeep to BATTLE the oncoming Nazis.

        Indiana CRAWLS along the jeep hood. TOWARD the Nazis. Mephisto
        attempts to SHOOT Indy. The bullets ZIP through the windshield.
        WHIZZING by Indy's head. Indiana GRABS Mephisto. He PULLS the Nazi
        over the windshield. Indiana and Mephisto TUMBLE along the jeep's
        hood. FIGHTING. STRUGGLING for the gun.

        The jeep DIRECTLY BEHIND Mephisto is filled with several CRATES OF
        DYNAMITE. GUTTERBUHG, back in uniform, rides here with THREE NAZI
        SOLDIERS. As the pygmy troops come forward, Gutterbuhg EXTENDS HIS
        MECHANICAL ARM. He ZAPS several of the pygmies. KILLING them with
        deadly JOLTS OF ELECTRICITY.

        As the jeep PASSES through the City gates, Indiana and Mephisto
        continue to BATTLE along the hood.

<b>        INT. CITY
</b>
        Mephisto ATTEMPTS TO SHOOT Indiana. But Indy PUSHES AWAY the Nazi's
        arm. The gun FIRES. HITTING the jeep driver, who SLUMPS over the
        wheel. The speeding jeep SPINS OUT OF CONTROL. It FLIPS. Sending
        Indiana and Mephisto FLYING through the air. They TUMBLE to the
        ground. The jeep CRASHES into a wall.

        A SHAKEN Indiana gets to his feet. Mephisto LIES A few feet away. OUT
        COLD. Suddenly, a BLAST OF ELECTRICITY BURSTS INTO FRAME! SPARKING the
        ground beside Indiana. Indy TURNS and sees GUTTERBUBG! The Nazi's jeep
        has ENTERED the city. Gutterbuhg POINTS his mechanical arm toward
        Indy. ANOTHER ELECTRICAL SHOCK ejects from his finger. Indy DIVES. The
        shock TEARS A SMOLDERING HOLE through the building behind him. Only
        INCHES above Indy.

        Meanwhile, the Nazis begin to UNLOAD the dynamite from Gutterbubg's
        jeep. They UNWRAP a long, section of FUSE from a large coil. Placing
        the fuse ALONG THE GROUND.

        Indiana is RUNNING for his life. Gutterbuhg is DIRECTLY BEHIND him. In
        HOT PURSUIT. The Nazi continuously FIRES ELECTRICAL SHOTS at Indiana.
        The thin lines of electricity WHIZ by Indy's HEAD. His ARMS. His LEGS.
        JUST MISSING INDY. A CAT AND MOUSE CHASE BEGINS, as Gutterbuhg PURSUES
        Indiana throughout the city.

<b>        TYKI AND SEVERAL PYGMIES
</b>
        They have CLIMBED to the top of the City Walls. From here, they GUARD
        and DEFEND their city. Crowds of NAZI TROOPS are on foot. Running
        TOWARD the city walls. The pygmies SHOWER the Nazis with ARROWS,
        SPEARS and POISINOUS DARTS. The Nazis fight back with MACHINE GUNS and
<b>        RIFLES. A HEATED, BLOODY BATTLE.
</b>
<b>                                                                        CUT TO:
</b>
<b>        SCRAGGY AND THE CREW MEMBERS
</b>
        They stand at the CITY GATE. PROTECTING the City entrance. They
        hurriedly load a large, wooden CATAPULT with a huge BALL OF HAY. A
        crew member TORCHES the hay. It BURSTS INTO FLAME. Scraggy CRIES
        "Fire!" His men LAUNCH the fireball. It SAILS over the City Walls.

<b>        THE FIREBALL
</b>
        LANDS directly onto a speeding NAZI JEEP. The Nazis and jeep CATCH
        FIRE! The vehicle LOSES CONTROL. The flaming jeep CRASHES into the
        side of a mountain wall.

<b>                                                                        CUT TO:
</b>
<b>        A NAZI TANK
</b>
        ROLLS toward the city. Its GUN BARREL aimed at the city walls. CAMERA
<b>        PANS AWAY, SEVERAL FEET AHEAD OF THE TANK. CAMERA MOVES UPWARD, TO THE
</b>        MOUNTAIN TOP, ABOVE the path. CLARE is here. A GROUP OF GORILLAS are
        beside her. The apes each have a TIGHT HOLD of individual sections of
        HANGING VINE. They stand at the EDGE OF THE RAVINE. Clare LOOKS to the
        OPPOSITE RAVINE. BETSY is here. She stands with ANOTHER GROUP OF
        GORILLAS, who also securely bold lengths of vine.

        On the mountain path, the Nazi tank PASSES DIRECTLY BENEATH Betsy and
        Clare. The two women TURN to the Gorillas. Emitting Gorilla GRUNTS,
        MOANS and MOTIONS, Betsy and Clare COMMUNICATE with the apes. The
        Gorillas LISTEN. NODDING. UNDERSTANDING. When the tank is DIRECTLY
        BELOW... Betsy and Clare ORDER the Gorillas to JUMP!

        The apes SWING from the mountain. RIDING the vines. TOWARD the tank.
        The Gorillas LAND on the tank. They CLIMB aboard. EXPLORING the tank's
        surface.

<b>        INT. TANK
</b>
        FILLED with Nazis. The gunner looks into the PERISCOPE. He is met with
        the reflection of a SNARLING GORILLA'S FACE. He SCREAMS and JUMPS
<b>        BACK.
</b>
        There is a sound of RIPPING METAL. Suddenly, the tank's top HATCH is
        TORN OPEN. COUNTLESS GORILLAS pour inside! The apes ATTACK.
        OVERPOWERING the Nazis.

<b>        EXT. TANK
</b>
        As the Gorillas climb inside of the tank, Betsy SWINGS across the
        passageway to Clare. She EXCHANGES a congratulatory handshake with
        Clare. Betsy's face suddenly goes WHITE. A SHOCKING SIGHT.

        A GROUP OF NAZIS have climbed to the mountain top. The soldiers SPOT
        Clare and Betsy. They RUN TOWARD the women. Betsy and Clare DASH OFF.
        Into the THICK of the jungle. The Nazis FOLLOW. In HOT PURSUIT.

<b>                                                                        CUT TO:
</b>
<b>        TWO LARGE CANVAS TRUCKS
</b>
        BARRELLING along the mountain path. KEZURE, the Pirate King, LEAPS
        from the side of the path, between the two trucks. Kezure climbs onto
        the REAR BUMPER of the FIRST TRUCK. The DRIVER of the SECOND TRUCK
        spots Kezure. He begins to FIRE SHOTS at the Pirate King. As bullets
        whiz by him, Kezure hurriedly removes a thick METAL CHAIN from around
        his neck. He securely CONNECTS the two truck BUMPERS with the chain.

<b>        INT. SECOND TRUCK
</b>
        Filled with NAZI TROOPS. SEATED. ARMED. Waiting to FIGHT. There is a
        sudden RIPPING SOUND. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. The NAZIS are
        STARTLED to see the BLADES OF COUNTLESS SWORDS. PIERCING the canvas.
        Through all SIDES of the truck. SEVERAL PIRATES leap through the
        canvas. ATTACKING the Nazis. The Nazis FIGHT BACK with bayonets and
        daggers.

<b>        INT. FIRST TRUCK - CABIN
</b>
        Two Pirates BURST into the cabin. They STAB the Nazi driver. The
        CACKLING Pirates take control of the steering wheel. They madly STEER
        the truck toward the steep EDGE of the mountain path.

<b>        THE FIRST TRUCK
</b>
        PLUMMETS over the eage. The second truck, ATTACHED by the metal chain,
        FOLLOWS the first truck. The two canvas trucks FALL into the moat!
        SPLASHING into the shark infestea waters!

<b>                                                                        CUT TO:
</b>
<b>        INT. CITY
</b>
        The Nazis have planted an enormous PILE OF DYNAMITE on the palace
        stairs. Enough to DESTROY the entire city. The T.N.T. is attached to a
        LONG FUSE, that stretches hundreds of feet, over VARIOUS SECTIONS of
        the city. The Nazis LIGHT the fuse end. It SPARKS. IGNITES. BURNING
        FAST. The Nazis TURN and RUN.

        Gutterbuhg continues to CHASE Indiana. BLASTS OF ELECTRICITY SHOOT
        from the Nazi's arm. Indy DUCKS... DODGES... AVOIDING the electrical
        jolts. Indy SPINS around a building corner. He spots the BURNING FUSE.
        It STRETCHES along the ground, moving up OVER a wooden fence. Indy
        DIVES and STOMPS OUT the fuse. But Gutterbuhg, who is directly behind
        Indy, RELIGHTS the fuse with a shot of electricity. Before Indy has a
        chance to stop the fuse...Gutterbuhg AIMS at Indy. Indy LEAPS OVER the
        fence. Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. The fence is SPLINTERED by the powerful
        electrical blast.

        Indiana runs into a small ALLEYWAY. The burning fuse STRETCHES up
        along the alley wall, moving to the ROOFTOP. Indy begins to climb the
        ancient golden bricks that PROTRUDE from the wall. TOWARD the roof.
        Gutterbuhg APPEARS. He SHOOTS at Indiana, who avoids the blast by
        LEAPING onto the roof. Gutterbuhg hurriedly begins to CLIMB the wall.
        FOLLOWING Indiana.

<b>        EXT. ROOFTOP
</b>
        Gutterbuhg ARRIVES at the top. He LOOKS around. There is NO SIGN of
        Indy. But the fuse RESTS at the roof's edge. UNLIT. Gutterbuhg
        RESTARTS the fuse. At that moment, Indiana LEAPS OUT from inside of
        the stone smokestack. He JUMPS the unsuspecting Gutterbuhg. They
        TUMBLE and FALL OFF the rooftop edge.

        Indiana and Gutterbuhg HIT the ground. They continue to STRUGGLE...
        FIGHT...as the fuse BURNS in front of them. It SPEEDS toward the pile
        of dynamite. Less than FIFTY FEET AHEAD. Still wrestling with
        Gutterbuhg, Indy ROLLS toward the fuse. Indy reaches out and STOPS THE
        FUSE with his hand. But Gutterbuhg MOVES FAST. Again, the Nazi
        RELIGHTS the fuse.

        Indy suddenly LEAPS to his feet. He RUNS OFF SCREEN. Gutterbuhg
        FOLLOWS. The fuse continues to BURN. Moving CLOSER...CLOSER...to the
        dynamite.

        Indiana runs to a CLUSTER OF TREES. He comes to an abrupt stop,
        between TWO TREES. Gutterbuhg is UPON HIM. The Nazi PAUSES. Only a FEW
        FEET from Indy. Gutterbuhg POINTS his arm at Indy. A CLEAR SHOT.
        Gutterbuhg SMILES. Indiana is TRAPPED.

        THE FUSE is now only a FEW FEET from the dynamite. It will BLOW at any
        second!

        Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy LEAPS OUT OF THE WAY,
        revealing a LARGE LAKE behind him. It's TOO LATE for Gutterbubg. The
        electrical current HITS THE WATER. The Nazi's body SURGES with
        electricity. Gutterbuhg FRIES. He SHIVERS. SHAKES. FROZEN, as the
        powerful electrical current FLOWS through his veins. SMOKE billows
        from his body. His mechanical arm suddenly EXPLODES. Gutterbuhg's
        charred body FALLS. FACE DOWN. ELECTROCUTED.

        Indiana LEAPS TO HIS FEET. Suddenly remembering... THE FUSE! It is now
        INCHES from the T.N.T. Indy can't get to it IN TIME. He GRABS his
        whip. His arm SNAPS FORWARD. The whip CRACKS. It SLICES the remaining
        fuse in two. The fuse FIZZLES and GOES OUT. The city is SAVED. Indy
        SIGHS. There is a GUNSHOT! A BULLET whizzes by Indy's head. He TURNS.

        MEPHISTO, bruised and bloodied from the jeep accident, stands SEVERAL
        FEET AWAY. Mephisto's LUGER is aimed at Indy. Prepared to take ANOTHER
        SHOT. Indy removes his REVOLVER. He FIRES at Mephisto. The Nazi DASHES
        into the COLISEUM. Indiana FOLLOWS.

<b>        TYKI

        BATTLING the oncoming Nazis with his sword. Tyki fights HARD. FAST. He
        manages to DEFEAT many Nazis. But the sword is suddenly KNOCKED from
        Tyki's hand. A TROOP OF NAZIS come toward him. Their eyes MURDEROUS.
        Tyki is TRAPPED. HELPLESS.

<b>        INT. CITY

        Scraggy and his crew members load ANOTHER FIREBALL onto the catapult.
        Scraggy cries "FIRE!" The fireball FLIES over the city walls. It lands
        DIRECTLY IN FRONT of the Nazi troops who are about to attack Tyki.
        Many of the soldiers CATCH FIRE. The others RUN from the flames. Tyki
        is UNHURT. He REJOINS his friends in the battle.

        BREATHLESS...FRIGHTENED...they continue to RUN through the jungle. The
        Nazis are a few feet BEHIND THEM. Moving FAST. Getting CLOSER. The
        women turn a corner, scramble through a section of bushes and find
        themselves face to face with...ANOTHER TROOP OF NAZIS.

        Clare and Betsy STOP. TRAPPED. SURROUNDED by Nazis. The soldiers MOVE
        TOWARD the women. The Nazis eyes are LECHEROUS. HUNGRY. Clare WHISPERS
        to a TREMBLING Betsy.

        Betsy NODS. The Nazis MOVE CLOSER. Clare looks to the SKY. She begins
        to make BIZARRE...HIGH PITCHED...NOISES. A CONFUSED Betsy makes the
        same noises. The Nazis LOOK at each other and CHUCKLE. The women
        CONTINUE to make the sounds.

        Suddenly, the exact sound seems to ECHO FROM THE SKY. It becomes
        LOUDER... LOUDER... But it belongs to A HUNDRED VOICES. The Nazis
        PAUSE. Looking UPWARD. PUZZLED.

        There is a SPLATTERING OF BIRDS. They ATTACK from above. The birds'
        screeching is IDENTICAL to Clare and Betsy's calls. The angry birds
        ATTACK THE NAZIS. PECKING. SCRATCHING. BITING. Clare and Betsy
        CONTINUE to make the sounds, which causes the birds to IGNORE THEM.
        The Nazis SCREAM. DROPPING their weapons. FALLING to their knees. Each
        soldier is COVERED with birds. They are being TORN TO SHREDS. Clare
        and Betsy TURN and RUN. ESCAPING into the jungle. The Nazis' screaming
        ECHOES behind them. As they run, Clare EXPLAINS to Betsy.

<b>        THE TWO CANVAS TRUCKS

        They crookedly FLOAT along the shark infested moat waters. The
        battered, bruised trucks now resemble two sinking PIRATE SHIPS. Kezure
        and the Pirates BATTLE the Nazis along the truck frames. The pirates
        fight in their element... WATER! With fast SWINGING SWORDS, the
        Pirates are defeating the Nazis. Several Nazis fall INTO THE WATER and
        are immediately ATTACKED by countless SHARKS.

        At one point, Kezure FALLS INTO THE WATER. Several SHARKS come for

        WATER. He holds a LIVE SHARK in his hands. The crazed Kezure TAKES A
        BITE from the shark. He TOSSES the fish back into the water. Kezure
        CHEWS ana SWALLOWS the raw shark meat. BLOOD spills down his chin.
        Kezure resumes his FIGHTING with the Nazis, as the two truck frames

<b>        INT. COLISEUM
</b>
        Indiana WALKS across the coliseum floor. REVOLVER in hand. He moves
        SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY. He is looking for a SIGN of Mephisto. But
        everything is SILENT. CALM. DESERTED.

        Mephisto SNEAKS along the top wall of the coliseum. HIDING behind the
        row of surrounding BELLS. The Nazi UNLATCHES the chain that holds all
        of the bells in place. The bells begin to FALL. THUNDERING down the
        coliseum stairs.

        Indy COVERS his ears. The sound of countless CLANGING BELLS is nearly
        deafening. He TURNS. Seeing the enormous bells ROLLING TOWARD HIM!
        Indiana begins to RUN. GIANT ROLLING BELLS CHASE HIM FROM ALL
        DIRECTIONS! Indy TWISTS...TURNS...LEAPS...in an effort to avoid being
        CRUSHED by the heavy bells.

        Mephisto WATCHES from above. SMILING.

        Indy CONTINUES to run. A giant ROLLING BELL chases him from behind.
        The bell GAINS SPEED. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. A few feet in front of
        Indy...is the deadly TIGER PIT. But Indy CAN'T STOP RUNNING, or he'll
        be CRUSHED by the bell. Indiana LEAPS INTO THE PIT! The bell ROLLS
        DIRECTLY OVER the pit.

        But Indiana is SAFE. There is a FIVE INCH DROP from the ground, to the
        pit's OVERHEAD METAL BARS. Indy LIES on the bars. SAFELY above the
        countless TIGERS.

        The bells have all COME TO A STOP. They LIE around the coliseum
        ground. STILL. Only one bell GENTLY ROCKS. It slowly TEETERS on the
        coliseum stairs. It HASN'T yet rolled off.

        Indiana begins to CLIMB OUT out of the pit, when suddenly... ANOTHER
        GUNSHOT RINGS OUT. Indy is HIT. In the CHEST. He SLIPS. FALLS. Bis
        wounded body is SPRAWLED on the bars. TEETERING. Ready to FALL into
        the waiting tigers.

        Mephisto's luger is SMOKING. The Nazi WALKS down the coliseum stairs.
        He moves TOWARD Indiana. Seeing Mephisto heading for him... Indiana
        REMOVES his gun. He AIMS at the Nazi. But Indy's vision is BLURRED.
        His hand TREMBLES. Mephisto's silhouette nears... But the bullet ZIPS
        PAST Mephisto and STRIKES a section of wood below the teetering bell.
        This causes the bell to FALL...and slowly ROLL forward.

        Mephisto ARRIVES at the edge of the Tiger Pit. He is about to shoot
        Indy...then comes upon ANOTHER IDEA. Mephisto LOWERS the luger. He
        gives a SWIFT KICK to Indy's ribs. Indiana FALLS THROUGH the bars. His
        arm SHOOTS OUT. With his last bit of strength, Indy's hand GRABS HOLD
        of a bar. CLUTCHING on for dear life. His body DANGLES over the
        tigers. They SNAP at his legs. HUNGRY. GROWLING. Mephisto SMILES. He
        STEPS on Indy's fingers. GRINDING them beneath his boot heel. Indy
        CRIES OUT... He's going to FALL...

        Mephisto PAUSES. He HEARS something behind him. A CLANGING BELL.
        Getting CLOSER. LOUDER. Mephisto TURNS. He sees the GIANT BELL. COMING
        at him. Only INCHES AWAY. There is NO TIME to move. The bell ROLLS
        OVER MEPHISTO. KNOCKING him INTO THE PIT.

        Mephisto FALLS through the bars. INSIDE the pit. INTO the middle of
        the hungry tigers. Mephisto SCREAMS. The tigers are UPON HIM. The Nazi
        is RIPPED TO SHREDS. Within seconds, his screams are a MEMORY.

        A very WEAK Indiana still clutches the bar. He manages to BOOST
        himself out of the pit. He takes a FEW STEPS. WOBBLING. BLOOD pours
        from the wound in his chest. He STUMBLES. To his KNEES. His eyes ROLL
        BACK. He FALLS to the ground. His body is STILL. MOTIONLESS.

<b>        EXT. TANK

        The tank SPEEDS TOWARD THE ROWS OF CHARGING NAZI TROOPS. The Nazis
        STOP. SHOCKED to see their own tank coming at them. But the tank
        continues to BARREL AHEAD. Many of the Nazis are CRUSHED beneath the
        heavy tank treads. Others DROP their weapons and RUN. FRIGHTENED.

<b>        INT. TANK

        The Gorillas are ECSTATIC. HOWLING. CHEERING.

</b>
<b>        KEZURE AND THE PIRATES
</b>
        They have DEFEATED all of the Nazis. One of the canvas trucks has
        completely SUNK. Only a small section of the other truck JUTS OUT of
        the water. The Pirates CLING to the fleeting safety of the sinking
        truck frame, which is surrounded by several HUNGRY SHARKS. There are
        even TOO MANY maneaters for the powerful Kezure to handle. As the
        frame continues to SINK...the Pirates' feet get CLOSER...CLOSER...to
        the snapping sharks...

        Suddenly, a ROPE DROPS FROM OVERHEAD! Kezure LOOKS UP. SCRAGGY and his
        crew members stand on the DRAWBRIDGE. They have DROPPED the line.
        Kezure and the Pirates CLIMB upward. To SAFETY.

        On the drawbridge, Scraggy ASSISTS Kezure. Scraggy SMILES, repeating
        Kezure's earlier threat.

<b>                                        SCRAGGY

        Kezure LAUGHS. He EMBRACES Scraggy. They are joined by TYKI and the
        OTHER PYGMIES. A sudden CALM...a sudden SILENCE...overcomes the city.
        The battle has ENDED. The Nazis have been DEFEATED. The city is SAVED.
        But Tyki is SOLEMN. DISTRESSED. He STARES OFF SCREEN. CAMERA PANS TO
        HIS P.O.V. We see the countless BODIES OF PYGMIES. SPRAWLED on the
        ground. DEAD. The price you pay for FREEDOM. Suddenly, the silence is
        INTERRUPTED. Someone is CRYING. It is BETSY.

        Scraggy looks OFF SCREEN, to the direction of the sounds. The color
        LEAVES his face.

<b>        SCRAGGY'S P.O.V.
</b>
        A group of pygmies CARRY the limp body of Indiana Jones out of the
        coliseum. They GENTLY LOWER Indy's body to the ground. Clare and Betsy
        KNEEL beside Indy. TEARS run down Betsy's face.

        Scraggy suddenly BREAKS AWAY from the crowd. CAMERA DOLLIES WITH HIM
        as he runs toward Indy. Scraggy STOPS at Indy's body. Clare, eyes
        FILLED with tears NODS to Scraggy. She can BARELY utter the words...

        TEARS erupt in Scraggy's eyes. He breaks down CRYING. A startled
        KEZURE joins the others. CAMERA PULLS BACK to an extremely LONG SHOT.
        The entire village GATHERS around Indiana's body. Everyone is SOLEMN.
<b>        SILENT.

</b>
<b>        CLOSE-UP: INDIANA'S BODY.
</b>
        It is LYING in state. Resting on a BAMBOO STRETCHER. It is covered
        with EXOTIC, COLORFUL FLOWERS. CAMERA PULLS BACK. Indy is being
        carried by several, elaborately dressed PYGMIES. At the head of a long

        FUNERAL PROCESSION. Betsy, Clare, Scraggy and Kezure MARCH beside
        Indy's body. They also wear the ceremonial FUNERAL FLOWERS. Behind
        them, the body of BOHBALA is being carried. And behind the ruler, the
        bodies of all DEAD PYGMIES are being carried by the remaining
        VILLAGERS and GORILLAS. It is NIGHTIME. All mourners are carrying
        FLICKERING CANDLES. At the rear of the procession, a lone pygmy strums
        an UNUSUAL STRING INSTRUMENT. This creates a HAUNTING melody.

        CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A LONG SHOT, as we see the procession move
        through the city. The hundreds of flickering candles against the dark
        night sky create a BEAUTIFUL IMAGE. The procession arrives at a large
        STONE WALL. It appears to be a DEAD END. Tyki WALKS to the wall.

        He FALLS to his knees and begins to CHANT. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and
        Kezure WATCH. There is a SMALL RUMBLE. A hairline CRACK begins to form
        in the mountain. As if it were being DRAWN by an invisible hand, the
        crack forms a LARGE DOOR in the wall. The door slowly OPENS. An almost
        BLINDING WHlTE LIGHT emanates from inside. Tyki ENTERS. The procession
<b>        FOLLOWS.
</b>
<b>        INT. WALL
</b>
        The procession ascends a TWISTING STONE STAIRCASE, that spirals
        upward, where the light becomes BRIGHTER... BRIGHTER... At the
        stairway top, there is ANOTHER DOORWAY. Tyki and the others ENTER.
        Indiana's body is CARRIED through.

<b>        THE GARDEN OF IMMORTAL PEACHES!
</b>
        A breathtakingly beautiful forest of never ending luscious green
        trees, filled with succulent, ripe PEACHES. We have never seen COLORS
        like this. So MAGICAL...so INTENSE... Bright SUNLIGHT shines from a
        vivid blue sky. There is always a RAINBOW here. The procession ENTERS.
        Scraggy, Clare, Betsy and Kezure stare in total WONDERMENT. Betsy is
        PUZZLED by the bright sunlight.

                        the night...

        Tyki WHISPERS to Scraggy, who explains to Betsy.

</b>                        Sun always shine in the Garden of
                        Immortal Peaches.

        Clare NODS. Kezure is MESMERIZED by the peach trees. His mouth HANGS
        OPEN. He TURNS to Scraggy.

<b>                                        KEZURE
</b>                        These are the peaches that make one
                        ...forever young?...

        Scraggy NODS. Tyki LEADS the procession to a clearing in the garden.
        Many freshly dug GRAVES are here. All of the bodies are carried to
        SEPARATE GRAVES, including Indiana And Bohbala.

        A few feet ahead of the graves, rests the LARGEST PEACH TREE in the
        forest. It is much WIDER and TALLER than the others. There is a small,
        glass encased TOMB built into the tree. Inside of the tomb, is a TINY
        SKELETON. No more than FOUR FEET TALL. The skeleton is adorned with a
        LION SKINNED ROBE and golden CROWN. In its hand, the skeleton clutches
        the famous GOLDEN HOOPED ROD, a glorious, elaborate STAFF. An ancient
        inscription is ETCHED IN STONE over the tomb. Pointing to the
        inscription, Clare TURNS to Scraggy.

<b>                                        CLARE

                        "Our Lord... Our Master... Sun...
                        Wu... Kung"

        THE SOUND TRACK MUSIC RISES. It is the tomb of the STONE MONKEY KING.
        Clare exchanges an AWE INSPIRED glance with Betsy, then looks to the
        still body of Indiana.

<b>                                        CLARE
</b>                        Damn you, Jones! Why couldn't you be
                        here to share this with me!

        The pygmies begin to LOWER the dead bodies, including Indiana and
        Bohbala, into the ground. Tyki reads from ANCIENT SCRIPTURE. Scraggy
        SOBS on the shoulder of Kezure, who continues to stare in ASTONISHMENT
        at the peach trees.

        Suddenly, there is a RUMBLING SOUND. Followed by a slight, TREMOR. The
        trees begin to SWAY, as a HOWLING WIND rushes through them. The tomb
        of Sun Wu Kung GLOWS with a BRIGHT LIGHT. The glass surrounding the
        tomb suddenly SHATTERS. The skeleton's head TURNS. Its body RATTLES.
        Beginning to MOVE. The skeleton STEPS OUT OF THE TOMB.

        Everyone STARES in awe. TERRIFIED.

        The skeleton takes a FEW STEPS forward, STOPS, and RAISES its arms.
        HIGH in the air. The skeleton OPENS its mouth. Emitting a HIGH PITCHED
        ...UNEARTHLY...SCREECH! An ectoplasmic GREEN SMOKE seeps from the
        skeleton's fingers, slowly TRAVELING over the heads of the humans. The
        ectoplasm separates into several INDIVIDUAL LINES, that touch down
        upon EACH OF THE GORILLAS. The ectoplasm ENCIRCLES each the Gorilla's
        bodies. The Gorillas begin to RISE from the ground. HIGH in the air.
        The ectoplasm appears to be CARRYING them toward Sun Wu Kung. As the
        Gorillas TRAVEL through the air, their bodies begin to SHRINK. Growing
<b>        SMALLER. THINNER.
</b>
        The humans stare into the SKY. Watching the AMAZING, MAGICAL
<b>        TRANSFORMATION.
</b>
        As the Gorillas get CLOSER to Sun Wu Kung, their bodies have shrunken
        to TINY, HAIR-LIKE substances. When the Gorillas ARRIVE at the
        skeleton, they ATTACH themselves to his body. We see that the shrunken
        Gorillas are actually individual HAIRS on the skeleton's body. As the
        countless hairs CONVERGE, the skeleton begins to take SHAPE...FORM...

        SUN WU KUNG COMES TO LIFE! He is UNLIKE anyone or anything we have
        ever seen. HALF-HUMAN. HALF-HONKEY. His face is covered with WRINKLES.
        His wide eyes are COAL BLACK. PROBING. WARM. When he smiles, it is
        DEVILISH, but incredibly CHARMING. His movements are PERKY. QUICK. An
        extremely ADORABLE little fellow. Instantly LOVABLE. But there is a
        STRONG, POWERFUL presense about him. He is indeed, a HEAVENLY FIGURE.

        Sun Wu Kung LOOKS over the congregation. Everyone FALLS to their
        knees. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and a RELUCTANT Kezure do the same.

        Sun Wu Kung PACES through the clearing. He LOOKS into the many graves.
        He is DISTRESSED. TROUBLED. His wrinkled face twists into FURIOUS
        expression. He RAISES his golden hooped rod to the sky. He SCREAMS.
        His old voice CREAKS and GROANS.

<b>                                        SUN WU KUNG

        Betsy WHISPERS to Clare.

</b>                        He is a heavenly being. According to
                        legend, when a heavenly being
                        speaks, men of all countries can
                        understand him. We hear him in
                        English...the pygmies hear him in
                        their language.

        Betsy NODS. Sun Wu Kung CONTINUES his heartfelt scream into the
        heavens.

<b>                                        SUN WU KUNG
</b>                        Return their souls!... I demand
                        it!... Return their souls!

        A few MOMENTS pass. Then...a thick, white cloud ECLIPSES the sun. A
        small hole in the cloud, allows one RAY OF SUNLIGHT to shine through.
        The ray shines down upon ONE PARTICULAR PEACH TREE. Sun Wu Kung TURNS
        to that peach tree. He raises the GOLDEN HOOPED ROD toward the tree.
        He begins to SING an unusual hymn. Suddenly, several peaches magically
        FLY from the trees. They congregate ABOVE the golden hooped rod. The
        peaches SPIN in midair. With quick movements of the rod, Sun Wu Kung
        SENDS several peaches flying OFF SCREEN.

        CAMERA FOLLOWS the magical peaches as they SEPARATE and FLY INTO EACH
        GRAVE. Toward the BODIES OF THE DEAD PYGMIES. Each body is HIT with an
        individual peach. When the peaches MAKE CONTACT with the dead bodies,
        there is a small, colorful EXPLOSION. A small FIREWORKS display. The
        bodies erupt with a BRIGHT GOLDEN GLOW. A few moments PASS. One of the
        bodies STIRS. MOVES. The body SITS UP. Gets to its FEET. ANOTHER BODY
        does the same. So does ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Soon, the various pygmies
        CLIMB out of the graves. Their wounds have DISAPPEARED. Their life has
        been RESTORED.

        Sun Wu Kung flings the remaining TWO PEACHES into the GRAVES of
        Indiana and Bohbala. There is a small EXPLOSION...followed by the WARM
        GLOW of their bodies. The wound in Indy's chest VANISHES. His eyes POP
        OPEN. To the delight of his friends, Indy STANDS. ALIVE. He is
        PUZZLLED by the surrounding grave. Clare, Scraggy and Betsy HELP
        Indiana OUT of the grave. They SHOWER him with EMBRACES and KISSES.
        But Indy remains CONFUSED. PUZZLED.

        Sun Wu Kung, looking very PLEASED with himself, stands BEHIND Indiana.

                        I would like to return the favor.

        Sun Wu Kung gives Indiana the GOLDEN HOOPED ROD. Indiana takes the
        PRICELESS ARTIFACT. He STARES at the beautiful rod. He is very MOVED.
        SPEECHLESS. Sun Wu Kung EXPLAINS. RAISES an eyebrow.

        Indiana SMILES.

        Meanwhile, Kezure uses the oppurtunity to SNEAK AWAY. He DISAPPEARS
        into a cluster of PEACH TREES. He CLIMBS the smallest tree. The GREEDY
        Pirate King begins to PICK several peaches. HIDING them in his
        pockets.

        Sun Wu Kung LOOKS OVER the healthy, restored community of pygmies. The
        Monkey King SMILES.

        Sun Wu Kung again RAISES his arms. Green ECOTPLASM again emanates from
        his fingers. The individual strands of HAIR fly from his body. In a
        reversal of what we saw only moments ago, the strands of hair FLY
        through the air. They grow LARGER...LARGER...until they resume the
        shape of the GORILLAS.

        Sun Wu Kung has RETURNED to his skeletal form. He TURNS and WALKS back
        to his resting place. The pieces of broken glass RE-ASSEMBLE. SEALING
        the tomb.

        Kezure, his pockets STUFFED with peaches, hurriedly REJOINS the
        others. Tyki EMBRACES Bohbala, glad to have his Father ALIVE. Bohbala,
        resuming his position as Ruler, LEADS HIS PEOPLE out of the garden.
        Indiana, CLUTCHING his golden hooped prize, EXITS with the others.

<b>        EXT. CITY GATES - THE FOLLOWING MORNING
</b>
        Indiana, Clare, Betsy, Scraggy, Kezure, the Pirates and Crew members,
        have GATHERED outside of the city walls for the journey home. They are
        saying "Goodbye" to TYKI, BOHBALA And the other PYGMIES.

        Clare and Tyki exchange a TEARFUL FAREWELL, communicating in hand
        signals. They share a final EMBRACE. Bohbala again THANKS Indiana for
        his help. Betsy says "Goodbye" to the many GORILLAS. Betsy
        COMMUNICATES in Gorilla hand motions and growls.

        Indiana, holding the Golden Hooped Rod, TURNS and moves across the
        drawbridge. The others FOLLOW. The entire city of pygmies and Gorillas
        CHEER for their departing friends. Indy and the others DISAPPEAR into
        the clouds, walking down the MOUNTAIN PATH. The Lost city GLISTENS in
        the background. The drawbridge CLOSES...until the next visitor
<b>        ARRIVES.

<b>        EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - A FEW HOURS LATER
</b>
        Early AFTERNOON. The sun is HOT. SCORCHING. Indy and his party REST.
        They NAP in a shady section of the path. CAMERA PANS THE SNOOZING
        BODIES of everyone, coming to a STOP at Indiana. The Golden Hooped Rod
        RESTS beside Indy. A HAND COMES INTO FRAME and GRABS the staff. OTHER
        HANDS MOVE INTO FRAME. They STEAL Indy's WHIP and REVOLVER. They TAKE
        all weapons from Scraggy and his crew members.

        Indiana is awakened by a SWORD. At his THROAT. Indy REACHES for his
        gun and whip...GONE. He LOOKS UP. KEZURE stands over him, holding the
        sword in one hand, the GOLDEN ROD in another. Indy TURNS. The other
        Pirates hold SWORDS and DAGGERS at the throats of Clare, Betsy,
        Scraggy and the crew members. Kezure TWIRLS the golden hooped rod in
        front of him. He SMILES at Indiana.

</b>                        Son of a bitch.

        Kezure LAUGHS. He has REMOVED a peach from his pocket. He SHINES the
        peach on his cloak, and gives a SHRUG to Indiana.

<b>                                        KEZURE
</b>                                (shrugs, laughs)
                        I am an old Pirate, Doctor Jones. Do
                        you suddenly expect me to treat you
                        with kindness and fairness?... It is
                        not my way of life!

        Indy is DISGUSTED. Kezure TAKES A LARGE BITE from the peach. As he
        chews and swallows, Kezure NODS to his men, motioning toward Indy and
        the others.

<b>                                        KEZURE
</b>                        Kill them...
                                (takes another bite of
                                the peach)
                        But save their hair. I will make a
                        coat out of it.

        The men MOVE to kill Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the crew members.
        Suddenly, Kezure emits a LOUD SCREAM. He GRABS his stomach in pain. He
        FALLS to his knees. The HALF EATEN PEACH rolls from his hand. Onto the
<b>        GROUND.
</b>
        Indy and Clare RUSH TOWARD Kezure. Something very STRANGE is happening
        to the Pirate King... His hair begins to FALL OUT. His teeth ROT. His
        skin SHRIVELS. His body becomes THINNER. SPINDLY. Kezure has begun to
        RAPIDLY AGE. He continues to SCREAM. In horrible PAIN.

        The Pirates STEP AWAY. FRIGHTENED. The others WATCH IN HORROR.

        Kezure's body CONTORTS. His skin WITHERS... FLAKES... It begins to
        PEEL from his bones. His screams FADE... His eyeballs ROLL OUT of
        their sockets. Only his skeleton REMAINS. It turns BLACK and CRUMBLES
        TO DUST. Only his elaborate clothing REMAINS. The many stolen peaches
        ROLL OUT of his cloak, onto the ground.

        The remaining Pirates DROP THEIR WEAPONS. They RUN OFF down the
        mountain. SCARED to death!

        Indiana HOLDS the half eaten peach in his hand. Betsy is PUZZLED.

                                (pause)
                        Kezure was evil. His heart was
                        filled with greed.

        Indiana DROPS the peach to the ground. He grabs his WHIP, REVOLVER and
        GOLDEN HOOPED ROD. Scraggy and his crew members RETRIEVE their
        weapons. Everyone TURNS, CONTINUING down the mountain path. LEAVING
        Kezure's clothes and the several peaches behind.

        Passengers board a large OCEAN LINER, bound for the United States.
        INDIANA JONES is here. Bags PACKED. He holds a rectangular wooden
        crate, covered with the words "FRAGILE". The Golden Hooped Rod is
        obviously STORED inside. Indy is WAITING for someone. He impatiently
        CHECKS his wristwach. LOOKING around. He GRUMBLES to himself.

                        five minutes...

        Suddenly, a HORN interrupts. Indy turns to the DIRECTION OF THE SOUND.
        It is SCRAGGY. He is wearing DRIVING GOGGLES. He rides a battered,
        bruised MOTORCYCLE, attached to a ricketty SIDECAR. The word "TAXI" is
        painted on the sidecar's exterior. Scraggy PULLS UP beside Indiana.
        Scraggy JUMPS OFF the motorcycle. Excitedly, he RUNS toward Indy.

                        something for your journey!

        Scraggy FUMBLES through his pockets. He removes a small bottle of
        PURPLE LIQUID. He HOLDS it out to Indy.

        Indy DECLINES. He flashes a FLASK OF WHISKEY from inside of his coat
        pocket.

        not move, WRAPPING HER ARMS around Indy. The Gorilla WRESTLES Indy to
        the ground.

        By using Gorilla HAND MOTIONS and GRUNTS, Clare manages to persuade
        BONZO to MOVE AWAY from Indiana. Indy WIPES his mouth. Clare, Betsy

        INVISIBLE HANDS. They FALL OUT of the box. DROPPING to the floor. ONE
        by ONE. The box SLOWLY OPENS. The Golden Hooped Rod SHIKMERS in the
        moonlight. Suddenly, the staff begins to MOVE. TWISTING. SHRINKING. It

        Indy WAKES. He SITS UP and sees the Golden Hooped Rod. At first, he is
        SHOCKED. He TOUCHES the rod...then comes upon a REALIZATION. The
        CREAKY VOICE of Sun Wu Kung FILLS the SOUNDTRACK.

<b>                                        SUN WU KUNG (V.O.)
</b>                        The Golden Hooped Rod will be a
                        faithful friend. It is capable of
                        one hundred transformations...and
                        will always remain by your side.

        Indy STANDS. He turns and LOOKS out of the porthole. A DREAMY...
        SATISFIED smile covers Indy's face, as he stares at the stars ABOVE.
        SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS. CAMERA PULLS BACK, TO EXTREMELY LONG SHOT of
        the ship SAILING across the ocean.

<b>                                        THE END
