</b>            According to the backer's list you

            thousand.  There's two thousand
            dollars unaccounted for.

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK
</b>            I went to a Turkish bath, who cares?
            The show was a flop.  What

<b>                         BLOOM
</b>            It makes a great deal of difference.
            That's fraud.  If they found out,
            you could go to prison.

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK
</b>            Why should they find out?  It's
            only two thousand dollars,  Bloom,
            do me a favor, move a few decimal
            points around.  You can do it.
            You're an accountant.  The word

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK

            through life.  Bialystock has
            struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going

            all I can offer is failure.  Bloom,

<b>                         BLOOM

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK

<b>                         BLOOM
</b>            Well, it's very easy.  You simply

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK

<b>                         BLOOM
</b>            You've done it yourself, only you
            did it on a very small scale.

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK
</b>            What did I do?

<b>                         BLOOM
</b>            You raised two thousand more than

</b>            So what?  What did it get me?  I'm

</b>            Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK

<b>                         BLOOM
</b>            Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play
            were a hit, you'd have to pay off

            That's because you were taken in by
            that verdampter Allied propaganda.
            Such filthy lies.  But nobody said
            a bad vord about Winston Churchill,
            did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!
                   (he gestures V for victory)
            Churchill, vit his cigars and his
            brandy and his rotten paintings.
            Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would
            say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not
            Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me
            tell this, and you're getting it
            straight from the horse, Hitler vas
            better looking than Churchill, he
            vas a better dresser than Churchill,
            had more hair, told funnier jokes,
            and could dance the pants off

</b>            No be cruel.  Be brutal.  Be brutal.
            Because heaven knows they will.
            Well, what do you think, Mr. Bloom?

<b>                         BLOOM

            Well, it's... uh... it's nice and

            It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous.
            You couldn't have picked a better
            color.  It brings out your eyes.
            Let's face it, Roger, that dress is
            you.

            We can't tell a thing without your
            wig.  As far as I'm concerned,
            you're only half-dressed.

<b>                         DE BRIS
</b>            Ummmm.  Well, if you're so worried
            about the wig, get it, o' wicked
            witch of the west.

<b>CARMEN TURNS IN A HUFF AND LEAVES TO GET THE WIG.  DE BRIS

<b>                         DE BRIS
</b>            Didn't I meet you on a summer cruise?

<b>HE LIGHTS THE CIGARETTE BUT CONTINUES TO HOLD BLOOM'S HAND.
</b>
<b>                         BLOOM
</b>            I've... I've... never been on a

<b>                         DE BRIS

<b>                         DE BRIS

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK
</b>            Roger, do you mind if we talk a

<b>                         DE BRIS
</b>            Please, please, that's what we're
            here for.
                   (to Carmen, who is
                   adjusting the wig)
            Be careful, that hurt.

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK
</b>            I think this would be a marvelous
            opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to
            now, you've always been associated
            with musicals, and...

<b>                         DE BRIS
</b>            Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey
            gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-
            turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to
            make you throw up!  At last a
            chance to do straight drama!  To
            deal with conflict, with inner
            truth.  Roger De Bris presents
            history.  Of course, I think we
            should add a little music.  That
            whole third act has got to go.
            They're losing the war.  It's too
            depressing.  We'll have to put
            something in there.
                   (gripped by his vision)
            Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of
            beautiful girls, dressed as Storm
            Troopers, black patent leather
            boots, all marching together...
            Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn-
            kick-turn!

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK
</b>            That's genius.  That's genius.
            Roger, I think I speak for Mr.
            Bloom and myself when I say that
            you're the only man in the world
            who can do justice to SPRINGTIME

            Wait a minute.  This is a very big
            decision.  It might effect the
            course of my entire life.  I'll
            have to think about it.  I'll do it.

</b>            Here's a little thing I think
            you're going to see on the charts
            any day.  I wrote it last night in
            my sleep.  It's a Hindu Zen Folk
            Rock Ballad.

<b>LSD SINGS "I'M THE VICTIM OF A MULTI-MYSTIC FREAK-OUT." THE
</b><b>SONG IS GEARED TO THE AU COURANT "RAGA ROCK" BEAT.  PHRASES
</b><b>SUCH AS, "CONNECT WITH THE INFINITE" AND "TURN ON THE

</b>                   (quickly)
            Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a
            man of his time.  This is a man of
            his time.

<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>            But he has long hair!

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK
</b>            Don't look at the outside, look at
            the inside.  It's the inner Hitler
            we're after.  The young beautiful
            Hitler, who danced his way to glory.

<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>            I don't know.  I don't know.

<b>                         DE BRIS
</b>                   (he has been studying
                   LSD intensely)
            Could be an exciting piece of off-
            beat casting.  Of course, we'd have
            to do something about that coiffure.

<b>                         LIEBKIND

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK

            let you down.

<b>                         LIEBKIND

            How could this happen?  I was so
            careful.  I picked the wrong play,
            the wrong director, the wrong cast.
            Where did I go right?  We forgot
            one important, Bloom.  Adolf Hitler
            always drew a crowd.

            I'm turning myself in.  It's the

<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>            Qviet.  Qviet  This is very
            important.

<b>HE TURNS BACK TO HIS WORK.
</b>
<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>            Vait a minute.  Vait a minute.
            Male to male?  Male to female?
            Female to male?  Female to female?
            Vait a minute.  In people, male to
            female.  But electricity is strange.
            It's male to male.

<b>HE QUICKLY FINISHES THE CONNECTION.
</b>
<b>                         LIEBKIND

            Slow fuse, please.

<b>BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND HANDS LIEBKIND A ROLL
</b><b>OF FUSE.
</b>
<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>            Thank you.

<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>                   (as he works)
            Now ve take the slow fuse.  Tie one

<b>                         LIEBKIND

<b>THEY BEGIN TO MOVE BACK AS LIEBKIND SLOWLY SPOOLS OUT FUSE.

<b>                         LIEBKIND

                   (to Bloom)
            Shine your light on it.

<b>BLOOM SHINES LIGHT ON FUSE.
</b>
<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>            I don't know.  I don't know.  The

<b>LIEBKIND TAKES A WOODEN MATCH OUT OF HIS POCKET.
</b>
<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>            I must find out.  It is critical.

<b>HE STRIKES THE MATCH AND LIGHTS THE FUSE.  WHOOSH!  IT
</b><b>IGNITES.  THE SPARKS RUSH TOWARD THE MASTER CONNECTION.
</b><b>LIEBKIND CHARGES DOWN THE STAIRS AND CHASES AFTER THE QUICK
</b><b>BURNING FUSE FOR ALL HE'S WORTH.  HE CATCHES UP WITH IT JUST
</b><b>BEFORE IT REACHES THE MASTER CONNECTION AND QUICKLY STAMPS
</b><b>IT OUT.

<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>            Let's face it.  That was dumb.

<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>            Here.  You see.  This is the slow
            fuse.  It is much wider.  It has
            more resistance, more density.
            Therefore, it burns slower.

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK
</b>            You mean you had the slow fuse in
            your pocket all the time and you

<b>                         LIEBKIND

<b>CUT TO SIDE DOOR OF THEATRE.  THE DOOR OPENS SLOWLY.
</b><b>BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND TIPTOE OUT.  BLOOM SETS
</b><b>DETONATOR DOWN.
</b>
<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>            Und now for the final connection.

<b>HE WRAPS THE FUSE LEAD AROUND THE METAL CONTACT POLE AND
</b><b>RAISES THE PLUNGER.
</b>
<b>                         BIALYSTOCK
</b>            Wait.  I'll check to see if the

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK

<b>BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM CROUCH DOWN AND HOLD THEIR EARDRUMS.

<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>            Goodbye, my foolish fancy.  Goodbye,

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK
</b>            Do it!  Do it!

<b>LIEBKIND TENSES HIMSELF FOR THE PLUNGE.  HE STARTS AND STOPS.
</b>
<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>            I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a

            monster... but it's still my child.

<b>HE SOBS INCONSOLABLY.  BIALYSTOCK ROUGHLY PUSHES HIM ASIDE
</b><b>AND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR AND PLUNGES IT DOWN.
</b><b>HE HURLS HIMSELF TO THE GROUND AND COVERS HIS HEAD IN

</b>
<b>                         BIALYSTOCK
</b>                   (quizzically)
            Nothing.

<b>LIEBKIND GOES TO PLUNGER, RAISES HANDLE AND EXAMINES
</b><b>DETONATOR.
</b>
<b>                         LIEBKIND
</b>            Here is gut... of course, of course.
            In electricity, it's always male to
            female.  But with people, it's not
            always so.  Come ve must go back.

<b>                         BIALYSTOCK
