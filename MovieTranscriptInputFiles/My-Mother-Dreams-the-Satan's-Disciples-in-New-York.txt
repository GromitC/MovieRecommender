<b>                         THE SATAN'S DISCIPLES IN NEW YORK"
</b>


<b>            FADE IN:
</b>
<b>            EXT. SOUTH DAKOTAN FARM - DAY
</b>
            A lone farmhouse sits isolated against a prairie backdrop,
            silhouetted by a marbled dawn sky.

<b>            INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
</b>
            MARIAN PETERSON, a gray-haired woman in her late sixties,
            meticulously packs a suitcase.  She picks up a small, framed
            PHOTO from a chest-of-drawers and holds it up to her.

<b>            INSERT - PHOTO
</b>
            It's a picture of a man about Marian's age.  He has a sweet
            natured smile on his face.  Marian looks at it longingly,
            then packs it carefully in her suitcase between some sweaters
            and closes it up.

<b>            EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
</b>
            A paint-chipped truck rounds the corner on a dirt road
            leading into the farm.

            Marian, waiting on the porch, ready to go, rises and waves.

<b>            A FEW MOMENTS LATER -
</b>
            Marian's son, STEVE, dressed in jeans and flannel shirt,
            loads his mother's single piece of luggage into the bed of
            the truck, climbs back into the cab, where his mother is
            sitting, and drives off.

<b>                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>            EXT. THE SKY - DAY
</b>
            A JETLINER descending in the hot, cerulean sky.

<b>                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>            EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL - AFTERNOON
</b>
            Marian, looking a little forlorn and out of sorts, stands out
            by the taxi area with her suitcase on a tote, looking around
            for a cab, unsure what to do.

<b>            CURBSIDE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</b>
            MISCHA, a somewhat dissolute-looking Russian cabbie in his
            thirties, roughhouses Marian's single piece of luggage into
            the dirty, cluttered trunk of his cab.

<b>            INT. TAXI - DAY
</b>
            Marian is sitting in the back of the cab as Mischa opens the
            driver's side door and slams it shut, rattling Marian's
            nerves.

<b>                                MISCHA
</b>                          (brusquely)
                      Where to?

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      Are you sure you got my bag in?

<b>                                MISCHA
</b>                      What do you think?  I left it on the
                      curb?

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my
                      first time in New York.  Just a minute.

            Marian fumbles with a piece of paper she's rooted out of her
            purse.  

            Mischa, annoyed, slams the shift lever into Drive and lurches
            off.

            Marian leans forward into the rectangular opening of the
            Plexiglas partition.

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      I want to go to 526 East 5TH.  That's in
                      the East Village.  My daughter said it
                      would cost thirty dollars.

            In the REAR-VIEW MIRROR we glimpse Mischa giving Marian a sly
            look.

<b>                                                                 CUT TO:
</b>
<b>            EXT. LOCATION - DAY
</b>
            The TAXI passes on a turnpike, streaming with vehicles,
            headed toward Manhattan.  DRIVE-BY TRANSITION.

<b>            INT. TAXI - DAY
</b>
            Hurtling along.  Marian cranes her head through the partition
            and attempts to strike up a conversation with the surly
            cabbie.

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      I came to New York to visit my youngest
                      daughter.

<b>                                MISCHA
</b>                      And where is she?

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      She would have come to the airport to
                      meet me - she wanted to - but ... but,
                      she just started a new job and, well, I
                      guess no one drives here.

<b>                                MISCHA
</b>                      So, you come here all by yourself?

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently
<b>                      ...
</b>
<b>                                MISCHA
</b>                      ... Oh ...

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      ... And the children thought I should
                      take a trip.

<b>                                MISCHA
</b>                      Yeah.

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you
                      from?

<b>                                MISCHA
</b>                      Moscow.

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?

<b>                                MISCHA
</b>                      Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                          (disconcerted)
                      You mean it's dangerous?

<b>                                MISCHA
</b>                      Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.
                          (beat)
                      Not during the day.

            Mischa chuckles as Marian sits back in the cab.

<b>            ANGLE ON MARIAN -
</b>
            looking out the window, her face clouded with consternation.

<b>            EXT. BRIDGE - DAY
</b>
            Cars pouring into Manhattan over one of the many bridges
            spanning the East River.

<b>                                                                 CUT TO:
</b>
<b>            EXT. EAST 5TH STREET AND 2ND AVENUE - DAY
</b>
            The cab brakes to a halt, bringing Marian INTO THE FRAME, her
            face strickened with fear.

            Marian climbs out of the cab as Mischa, in the background,
            opens the trunk to retrieve her bag.  Marian, taking in the
            foreign surroundings, seems confused about something.

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      Pardon me, Mischa.  Is this 526 East 5TH
                      Street?

            Mischa closes the trunk and approaches Marian with her one
            piece of luggage on a tote.

<b>                                MISCHA
</b>                      No, no.  Sorry, I can't drive you to
                      door.  There's a roadblock on Avenue B
<b>                      ...
</b>                          (he gestures down the street)
                      right there ...

<b>            MARIAN'S AND MISCHA'S P.O.V. -
</b>
            At the far end of the block, we SEE a movable, blue NYPD
            roadblock.

<b>            BACK -
</b>
            The two of them, Marian looking puzzled.

<b>                                MISCHA
</b>                      This is one-way street.  You go down the
                      block to the middle.

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                          (pointing uncertainly)
                      This way?

<b>                                MISCHA
</b>                      Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.
                          (beat)
                      It's still day.

            He chuckles to himself, but Marian doesn't get the joke.

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      I see.  How much?

<b>                                MISCHA
</b>                      Forty-five all total.

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      Forty-five?  I thought it was only

            Marian unsnaps her wallet and grudgingly hands the
            disreputable cabbie two twenties and a five.

            Mischa takes the money and starts away.  Halfway back to his
            cab, he turns around and calls out to Marian, who stands
            frozen on the dilapidated street.

            Mischa hugs an imaginary purse close to his side.  Marian
            apes his advice in all seriousness.

            at an angle on their kickstands, and dismount.

            small, mean-looking man with a red bandana tied taut over his
            head, and then disappear into the windowless clubhouse,
            passing through a large, forbidding, black door with the
            skeleton of Death riding a motorcycle painted on it.

            Marian and Paula, arm-in-arm, walk down the block back to her
            building.

            A MOTORCYCLE rounds the corner, slows to a crawl, and one of
            the Satan's Disciples stares over at the two of them as if
            casing them out.  Paula won't look at him, but Marian can't

            on.  

            PAN ACROSS the FACES of the Disciples, mounted on their
            cycles, dark helmets, faded blue jeans jackets embroidered
            with elaborate stitching of their club's insignia, cigarettes
            dangling from their hirsute mouths, baleful-looking

            GO TO SLOW MOTION as the BIKERS, some ten in number, slowly
            approach the frail-looking Marian.  Gently, they pick her up
            off the ground and raise her aloft.  Then, like some moving
            human bier, they carry her through the forbidding black door
            into their clubhouse.

            Marian is again prevented from an easy exit when a young, hip
            looking COUPLE come bounding down the stairs.  As she stands
            at her open door to let them pass, they completely ignore her

            Seen from Marian's perspective across the street, the front
            of the Satan's Disciples headquarters is quiet.  There are
            only a couple Harleys parked out front.

            Marian, relieved that there are no bikers out, hurries off in
            the direction of First Avenue, determined to see the sights
            of the city.

            Marian comes INTO THE FRAME around the corner.  She has a

            But her sanguine mood is quickly shattered when she HEARS
            shouting.  She freezes in her tracks.

            The Disciple Prospect and another Biker are roughing up a

            The Bikers continue to roughhouse the Kid.  The Disciple

            squirts lighter fluid on the fire burning in the steel drum
            and the flames explode.  Then KID is dragged over toward the
            fire.  The Disciple Prospect drags him dangerously close to

</b>                      She's at work.  I'm her mother.

</b>                      Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.

            Marian, seemingly reassured, opens the door for her.  She
            sees Marika, realizes she's upset about something, and feels
            immediately compassionate toward her.

<b>                                MARIKA
</b>                      I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.

</b>                      Oh.  You need a cappuccino.

            And she lets Marika in.

            They're sitting at the dining table, having coffee.  Marian
            is listening sympathetically to Marika's tale of woe.

<b>                                MARIKA
</b>                      And there was this number on my phone
                      bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made
                      at three and four in the morning.  So, I
                      called the number ... and a woman
                      answered.  And I ... I hung up.
                          (leans forward)
                      So, then I followed him.  Just like in
                      the movies.  And I found out that he has
                      a wife and a little girl living in
                      Brooklyn.  We had been going together for
                      almost a year.

                          (Marika laughs)
                      And I hear that other women came forward.

            This makes Marika laugh even harder.  Marian's story seems to
            have assuaged her own grief in some parallel way.

            Marian crosses the street headed in the direction of the
            Satan's Disciples headquarters.

            The Disciple Prospect is sitting alone, guarding the line of
            parked Harleys.  He's wearing dark aviator shades and his
            trademark red bandana tied over his head.  Marian steps

            The Disciple Prospect removes his sunglasses and looks at her

            The Disciple Prospect emerges from the club with the HEAD
            DISCIPLE, a gentle giant of a man with a long, flowing wispy
            beard and an old man's paunch.  They're muttering about
            something.

            The Head Disciple glances over at Marian standing curbside,

            lounging about.  One has his nose in a book, The Road Less
            Traveled.  Another reads the Wall Street Journal.  Two others
            are seated at a card table, playing a game of poker.  Still
            another is sprawled on a couch, smoking a cigarette.  The
            walls are festooned with biker posters.  The place is a bit
            of a mess, but innocuous.

            The Head Disciple stands in the center of the room and
            addresses his clan.

            Amiable laughter fills the room.  Marian laughs with them. 
            She glances all around her, fascinated by this dungeon she
            had dreamed and fantasized about since she first arrived in

            Some of the Disciples exchange petulant looks, rolling their

                      from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse,
                      and I was so worried about her ...
                      so, I went over and introduced myself. 
                      And they were the nicest people.

            Paula and Mr. Palmer exchange disquieting glances.

            Paula is in a mild state of shock hearing her mother's
            fantastical anecdote.

            Paula is sitting at the dining table with a plate piled with
            roast chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in front of her.  She
            has a worried look etched on her face.

            Marian is in the kitchen in the background, feeling light and
            happy, a singsong quality to her voice.  She brings a plate
            of food for herself to the table.

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      And they were so friendly those young
                      men.  Though I do think they should shave
                      their beards and ... and get some nicer
                      clothes.

            Marian sits down at the table and takes a sip of her wine,
            picks up her utensils and gets ready to dig in.  She turns to
            Paula who isn't touching her food, her head in her hands. 
            Marian, seemingly oblivious of her daughter's feelings,
            prattles on.

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      What do you say ... we take a subway
                      uptown and see a play tonight?

            Marian finally notices that Paula isn't listening.

<b>                                MARIAN
</b>                      What's wrong?

                      such a thing, but ... how many of those
                      pills have you been taking?

</b>                      No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing
                      you too hard to do things on your own.

            Marian retreats into herself, sips her wine - as if she,
            herself, now wonders if she's lost her mind - and her buoyant
            mood deflates almost at once.

<b>                                PAULA
</b>                      The, um, other night, I got up to get a
                      glass of water and you were standing by
                      the window talking to daddy.  I called
                      out to you, but you didn't answer.  You
                      remember?

            Marian doesn't remember, and her daughter's words pierce her. 
            She's afraid to object.

<b>                                PAULA
</b>                      New York is a ... it's a strange place in
                      the summertime.  The noise, the warm air,
                      it's ... easy to imagine things.

            Paula lays a reassuring hand on Marian's arm, talks to her
            condescendingly, as if she were a child.

<b>                                PAULA
</b>                      Now, you know you didn't go into the
                      clubhouse, did you?

            Marian doesn't bother to argue, fearing anything she might
            say would compromise her.

<b>                                PAULA (CONT'D)
</b>                      It's okay.  Dad's dying put a lot of

                      all right.  We're all going to be all
                      right.  Where did you get this vivid
                      imagination, huh?

            Paula grips Marian's arm a little tighter and shakes it
            gently as if snapping her back to reality.  Marian returns
            her a tight-lipped smile.

            Marian, lying supine on the convertible sofa bed by the open
            window, snoring peacefully.

<b>            EXT. EAST 5TH STREET - NIGHT

            On the sidewalk, the Disciple Prospect sits next to the fire
            breathing oil drum, standing sentry over the Harleys.

            One of the Disciples comes out of the clubhouse and they high
            five.  The Disciple mounts his Harley and is about to kick
            start it to life, when the Disciple Prospect rises from his
            stool.

<b>                                DISCIPLE PROSPECT

            The Disciple about to start his bike, turns.  

            The Disciple Prospect raises two fingers to his lips in a
            kind of warning, then gestures up to Paula's co-op where
            Marian is sleeping.

            The Disciple, remembering the new rule, nods assent with a
            slightly annoyed expression.

            Then, he puts his Harley into neutral, dismounts, and starts
            slowly walking it down the quiet, ill-lit street.

            The room is cast in soft ambient light from the street. 
            Paula comes into the living room and lies down next to her
            mother on the sofa bed and rouses her awake.  Marian swims
            leadenly back to consciousness.

            Marian steps down the stairs of her daughter's building.  A
            smile breaks out on her face when she SEES:

<b>            A MOTORCADE -

            of idling Harleys in the middle of the street, waiting for
            her.

            turns to the Head Disciple, materializing behind her,
            carrying her luggage.  He gestures with his head toward the
            motorcycles.

<b>            THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET -

            The Disciple Prospect takes Marian's luggage from the Head
            Disciple and hauls it over to one of the waiting Harleys and
            straps it on to the carrying rack.

            Then, he helps Marian onto the back of the Harley she's going
            to be riding to the airport.  Gently, he places a helmet -
            festooned with decals of fire-breathing reptiles - over her
            head and affixes the chin-strap.

            Marian nods and beams at the same time.

            The other Harleys form a circle around Marian's motorcycle.

            The Disciple Prospect gives them a signal and they start off,
            one by one, forming a V-shaped procession.
