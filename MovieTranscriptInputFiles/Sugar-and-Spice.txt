</b>
  A large metal door SLAMS SHUT.

<b>                      OFFICER (O.S.)
</b>            Single file - stay to the right of the
            line...

<b>  FADE IN:
</b>
<b>  INT. POLICE STATION - WITNESS VIEWING ROOM - DAY
</b>
  PAN ACROSS the frightened faces of NINE WITNESSES, eyes fixed
  straight ahead.  A POLICE OFFICER walks slowly past each -
  FOOTSTEPS ECHOING in their fear.

<b>                      OFFICER
</b>            Take your time.  Take a good look.

  He passes a nervous SAFEWAY CASHIER in uniform.

<b>                      SAFEWAY CASHIER
</b>            Ah, a-are you sure they can't see us?

<b>                      OFFICER
</b>            Two-way mirror, ma'am.

  He passes a UNIFORMED CHEERLEADER, an OLDER WOMAN, then a
  FACTORY WORKER, who removes his "Lincoln, Local 186" cap and
  wipes his nervous brow.

<b>                      FACTORY WORKER
</b>            But they're trained killers.  A guy at
            the plant says, "In 'Nam they could
            smell ya!"

<b>                      OFFICER
</b>            This is the United States of America,
            Sir.

  Officer reaches the end of the line - presses an intercom.

<b>                      OFFICER (CONT'D)
</b>                (into intercom)
            Face front.

  Witnesses react - GASP - avert their eyes!

<b>  INT. POLICE STATION - LINE UP - DAY
</b>
  The source of their fear - FIVE UNIFORMED CHEERLEADERS
  against the suspect wall.  They look like deer caught in
  headlights. 
  A sixth cheerleader, DIAN WESTON, is helped up the steps. 
  One thing separates her from the rest - SHE'S SIX MONTHS
<b>  PREGNANT.
</b>
<b>                      DIANE
</b>                (friendly, to female officer)
            I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am, but is
            this going to take long?  It's game
            night.

<b>                      OFFICER
</b>                (on intercom)
            Picture in three --

  Like saying "walk" to a dog, the girls instantly smile.

<b>                      OFFICER (CONT'D)
</b>                (on intercom)
            -- two, one...

<b>  INT. POLICE STATION - LINE UP - DAY
</b>
  FLASH WHITE to INDIVIDUAL MUG SHOTS (with CREDITS) over
<b>  LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL SONG.
</b>
<b>                                     MATCH DISSOLVE WHITE INTO:
</b>
  A LIGHT hanging above a table.

<b>                      FBI AGENT (O.S.)
</b>            ...a heinous crime has been committed
            here...

<b>  CAMERA CRANES DOWN TO:
</b>
<b>  INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
  CAMERA TRACKS EYE LEVEL around the table where an FBI AGENT
  (mid-40's, black suit), sits across from LISA JANUSCH
  (cheerleader from the witness side) - pretty, in a man-made
  way - bitchy in a B-squad Cheerleader way.  Other black
  suited AGENTS stand in the room.  CHEERLEADER MUG SHOTS cover
  the table.

<b>                      FBI AGENT
</b>            ...and testifying in such a case is a
            serious matter.  Should you decide your
            testimony would jeopardize your personal
            safety.

<b>                      LISA
</b>            Look, "Sipowitz", I said I'd tell you
            everything - I was just hoping to finish
            up before menopause kicks in.

  She smiles sweetly to the agent, then pushes Diane's MUG SHOT
  toward him.

<b>                      LISA (CONT'D)
</b>                (dropping smile)
            Let's start with the one who thinks her
            shit don't stink.  Diane Weston.

<b>                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

<b>  INT. DIANE'S BATHROOM - MORNING

<b>  CLOSE ON
</b>
  Foggy, heart-shaped mirror.

<b>                      LISA (V.O.)
</b>            She's like a goddamn poster child for
            high school.

  A HAND ENTERS FRAME and WIPES CLEAR the mirror, REVEALING
  DIANE (pregnant cheerleader in opening - not pregnant now).

<b>                      DIANE
</b>                (to self in mirror)
            Morning, sunshine.  Remember, these are
            the best days of your life.

  She starts to leave - then comes back.

<b>                      DIANE (CONT'D)
</b>            -- so far!

  She bucks her chin in the mirror and smiles - she's beyond
  adorable.

<b>                      LISA (V.O.)
</b>            If I wasn't such a lady, I'd tell you
            what a bitch she really is.

  Sign reads "CHEERLEADING TRYOUTS."  PAN DOWN a long line of
<b>  HOPEFUL GIRLS.
</b>
<b>                      LISA (V.O.)
</b>            She's the A-squad captain - stole the
            title from me.  You should charge her
            with that...

<b>  END ON 
</b>
  Diane, pompoms on hips, smiles toward the camera.  A SIGN on
  the floor in front of her reads: "SQUAD MEMBER."  A SIGN to
  her left reads: "CHALLENGER".

  BRUCE, an effeminate young man, bounds up behind the
  "CHALLENGER" sign - putting his pompoms on hips.

<b>                      DIANE
</b>            Hey, Bruce!  You look cute...

<b>                      BRUCE
</b>                (off clothes)
            Tommy Hilfiger.  I'm hoping fourth
            year's a charm.

  He crosses his fingers and arms.  Diane smiles.  LISA runs in
  frame and SHOVES Bruce to the ground.

<b>                      LISA
</b>            Outta my way, fag.  I'm up.

  Humiliated, Bruce RUNS O.S.  Lisa takes his place, looks
  straight ahead and smiles, pompoms on hips.

<b>                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            This really should have been my year.  I
            had a lotta work done - I-I mean,
            y'know, I'd done a lotta work over the
            summer.

  Diane can't take her eyes off Lisa.

<b>                      DIANE
</b>            Lisa?...  Is-is that you?

  LISA'S STUDENT I.D. drops INTO FRAME - her nose is big, she
  has no chin.  

<b>                      LISA
</b>                (looks straight ahead)
            I lost a little weight.

<b>  I.D. LEAVES FRAME
</b>
<b>                      LISA (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            You could tell it made her nervous.

  Diane shakes her head in disbelief and turns forward.

<b>                      DIANE/LISA
</b>            Ready?
                (pompoms snap to waist)
            Okay!

  POMPOMS SNAP TO THIGHS and the CHEER BEGINS.  

  Diane is effortless as she glides, jumps and smiles through
  it - clearly better than Lisa.

<b>                      LISA (V.O.)
</b>            But they have to, y'know, spread the
            talent around, so I've been on the B
            squad for four years.

  Lisa pushes the rest of the mug shots toward the FBI agent.

<b>                      LISA
</b>            Now, the squad as a whole?  They're
            closer than Carolina cousins.  Some
            people say they're, like, lezbos or
            something.  But that's mostly just the
            yag-offs in band...

  FIVE PAIR of LEGS with MATCHING ANKLETS and WHITE KEDS dangle
  from the stalls.

<b>                      LISA (V.O.)
</b>            ...truth is, they're so close - they all
            get their monthly visit from "Aunt Rose"
            at the same time.

  A HAND REACHES UNDER the first stall, PASSING A BOX OF
  TAMPONS to the next stall - and so on down the line.

<b>                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            First, there's Hannah Wold...

<b>  FIRST STALL DOOR
</b>
  HANNAH WOLD, a large, pretty girl in uniform, exits and
  crosses to the mirror.

<b>                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            She's their base.  Strong as an ox. 
            She's like this Uber-Christian - doesn't
            say much.  I mean, if she wasn't kinda
            pretty, you'd go, "Hey, who's the tard?"

<b>  NEXT STALL DOOR
</b>
  CLEO MILLE, pretty, starlet-type, wears plenty of make-up. 
  She lifts the front of her uniform sweater, holds it with her
  teeth.

<b>                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            Then, there's Cleo Miller...

  She opens her purse, pulls out a gel breast and stuffs it in
  one cup of her bra.

<b>                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            Number one - not a natural blonde.

  She REPEATS for the other breast, then pulls her sweater
  down.

<b>                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            I know.  I've been in the locker room
            and seen south of the border.  Number
            two --
                (whispers)
            She has to see the school shrink.

  Cleo lifts the back of her skirt - REVEALING CONAN O'BRIEN'S
  face SILKSCREENED on her underpants (thought bubble above his
  head reads "Friday... I love Cleo.").  She KISSES HER HAND
  and plants it on his/her cheek.

            know if he has one, that's why it's a
            dream - and suddenly we're buck-naked
            and all oiled up.  I don't know where
            the oil comes from - again, that's why
            it's a dream.

  PRINCIPAL SMITH, a man who burned out long ago, stands behind
  a microphone on a small stage as he's done for 45 years. 
  The LINCOLN HIGH "FIGHTIN' LOG" MASCOT (looks like an angry
  Tootsie Roll with legs and overly muscular arms) stands
  beside him, pantomiming everything he says.  STUDENTS fill
  bleachers on either side.

</b>            The school year started off like normal. 
            Principal Smith gave his pep talk --

</b>                (reading from a list)

            when you urinate, have milky seepage or
            are being touched by an uncle - let

  GYM LIGHTS GO DARK.  STUDENTS SCREAM.  DRUM CORP. and BRASS
  BAND start "ROCK & ROLL PART II" by Gary Glitter.

  The SPOTLIGHT RACES around the gym before it hits center
  court.  The A-squad springs to their feet for an amazing
  cheer/dance - strong, sexy, acrobatic, non-traditional.

<b>                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            Now, I know it's my duty to give you all
            the facts, so I have to say that their
            cheer blew like a bulimic after
            Christmas dinner.  Their blatant
            disregard for National High School
            Cheerleading Association rules made me
            sick.  "Basket toss flips and wolf wall
            pyramids over two people high are

<b>                      DENNIS

  All enter the FOYER.  Jack looks gorgeous in his tux.  His
  parents are just like Diane's - mid-40's housewife and middle
  management drone.  Their children are their lives.

<b>                      DENNIS (CONT'D)
</b>            Say Jack, why don't you go light a fire
            under Diane.

</b>            I'm on it, Mr. Weston.

  Jack smiles and bounds up the stairs - two at a time.

</b>            Oh - say, where're my manners.  I'm
            DeeDee - you can remember me because of
            my double "D's."

  She LAUGHS with Dennis as if it's the first time she's said
  it.  We see where Diane gets her perk - and her body.

<b>                      DENNIS
</b>            And I'm Diane's Dad, Dennis.  Do not try

</b>            Me and Diane, uh... we decided we're

  The parents react with shock, then absolute joy!  DeeDee
  starts to cry - turning the CAMERA on HERSELF.

</b>            Well, if I had to guess...
                (convincing self)
            I'd say that was the sound of a mother

            daddy of his own...

  FIVE PAIR of LEGS with HIGH HEELS dangle from the STALLS. 
  (We've seen this shot before.)  MUSIC from the dance presses
  through the walls.  A HAND REACHES UNDER the first stall,
  PASSING A BOX OF TAMPONS to the next stall.

<b>                      LISA (V.O.)

            No thanks - don't need one.

  FIRST STALL DOOR FILES OPEN, followed by the SECOND, THIRD -
  it sticks, Kansas climbs over - and FOURTH!  (Cleo exits
  fixing her gel breast.)  The squad surrounds Diane's stall
  door.  She finally exits.

  MUZAK UP.  A worried Diane, now showing slightly under all
  black warm-ups, is writing on her notepad as she walks down
  an aisle.  Suddenly, in the B.G. CROSS AISLE, an ecstatic
  Jack, in "Video Barn" uniform, WHIZZES PAST, riding his cart. 
  Arms out at his sides.

<b>                      JACK
</b>            I'm on top of the world!

  Seeing Diane, he tries to stop, but can't and continues past. 
  A SECOND LATER, he scrambles back and rides up to her -
  tossing more boxes into the already FULL CART.

<b>                      JACK (CONT'D)

            But Di, all this food reminds me of how
            much I want to teach our baby.

  He tosses more cereal in the cart.  Diane looks at her
  notepad, then starts to return items to the shelves WITHOUT
<b>  JACK NOTICING.

  He kisses her as SHE SLIPS ANOTHER BOX on the shelf.

            machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and
            get a place in line.

  He kisses her again and runs off.  Diane watches him - the
  love in her eyes quickly turns back to worry and she starts
  to put everything back on the shelves: cookies, cereal,
  chips, ice cream - oh, that struggle, but it goes...

<b>  INT. SAFEWAY CHECK OUT STAND - LATER

  Diane emerges with an almost empty cart.  Just milk, peanut
  butter, bread and a large roast are all that remain.

<b>                      JACK (O.S.)
</b>            Hey, Di!

  Diane turns to see Jack, a couple aisles over, holding out a

<b>                      JACK (CONT'D)
</b>                (in a funny voice)
            Hello, I'm the little professor. 
            Wouldn't it be cute if ours looked like
            this?!

  A WOMAN RUSHES over and ANGRILY grabs her kid back from Jack,
  punches him and storms off.  Diane rushes in line, ditching
  the roast in a gum rack beside the check-out.

  As she struggles with it, she notices a WOMAN at the LINCOLN
  SAVINGS AND LOANS BRANCH (inside the Safeway at the end of
  the check-out aisles) putting out a HELP WANTED sign.

  Jack drives as Diane devours a king size Snickers bar.

            Mmm-hmmm...

  Unseen by Jack, Diane slips her hand out the partially open
  window, releasing a PAGE from her NOTEPAD.

  On the BLOWING LIST as the Mustang drives on:

<b>                      DIANE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

  In the UNFOCUSED B.G., Diane opens her door and crawls out,
  about to toss her cookies.  In the F.G., the LIST settles on
  the road: FROM THE BEAUTIFUL MIND OF DIANE is a pre-printed
  on the top.  Diane wrote "Monthly Income" column which totals
  "$525."  Her "Monthly Bills" column totals "$845."  "ONE
  MONTH LEFT" is scribbled at the bottom.

  Oscillating fan behind him.  Follow the smell as it drifts

  he's exhausted and the competition is gaining.

  Everything grinds to a SLO-MO CRAWL as Jack makes a heroic

  smother a huge yawn, as opposing players come flying at him

            think we could learn to rob a bank from

            from movies.  But robberies?  There's no
            way.

  Cleo sets the HAND-PIECE on Diane's belly.  The squad stares
  in wide-eyed wonder at the monitor - for the first time they
  see Diane's baby.  Diane doesn't notice.

            drawer.  I guess I can just do that...

            the birth canal, will normally expand
            its folded walls to allow for the birth
            process...

  Suddenly Diane and the squad walk across the screen.

  approaches and hands her some money.  The Older Woman starts
  to SLOWLY COUNT OFF TICKETS from a roll.

  Impatient, Lisa grabs the roll, rips off some tickets, tosses
  the roll on the table and STORMS OFF.  The Older Woman
  UNLOCKS THE METAL BOX (key around her neck), PUTS THE MONEY
  IN, then SHUTS IT.

  counts off tickets, smiles and gives them to Diane who bends

  The Older Woman UNLOCKS the metal box to put the money in as
  KANSAS ENTERS, FALLS TO THE GROUND and fakes CHOKING.  Cleo
  runs up to Kansas - begging for help.

  The Older Woman hurries around the table to help as Hannah

  Kansas holds up a hand and counts off ONE, TWO, THREE
  FINGERS.  All pull the RED RIBBON off their rose box with one
  hand - smoothly grabbing the guns they've glued and taped
  together with the other - as they move into their next
  position (Kansas and Hannah take point as Diane, Cleo, Lucy

  box, dropping her gun.  The barrel falls off, CLANKING as it
  rolls away from her.  Nixon helps her stick it back together.

  EVERYONE near the bank starts to get down.  Unable to "go
