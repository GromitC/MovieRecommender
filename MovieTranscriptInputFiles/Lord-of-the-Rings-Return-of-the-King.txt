<b>EXT. RIVER ANDUIN - DAY
</b>
ANGLE ON: SMEAGOL and his cousin, DEAGOL, sit in a SMALL
CORACLE, their FISHING LINES draped over the side . . . SUNSHINE
glinting off the surface of the water.

An idyllic image.

SUDDENLY . . . DEAGOL's FISHING ROD BENDS under the weight of a
<b>LARGE FISH.
</b>
<b>                        DEAGOL
</b>                 (excited)
            Smeagol, I've got one!
                 (he laughs)
            I've got a fish, Smeagol!

<b>                       SMEAGOL
</b>                 (excitedly)
            Go on, pull it in.

DEAGOL pulls on his ROD, but is HAULED OVERBOARD and
disappears underwater with a SPLASH!

ANGLE ON: SMEAGOL leaning over the BOAT . . . CONCERNED.

                       SMEAGOL (cont'd)
                 (worried)
            Deagol!

<b>EXT. UNDERWATER, RIVER ANDUIN - DAY

<b>EXT. RIVER ANDUIN, GLADDEN FIELDS - DAY
</b>
CLOSE ON: DEAGOL climbs out of the WATER, onto the RIVER
<b>BANK.
</b>
CLOSE ON: the RING   revealed in DEAGOL'S PALM . . .

ANGLE ON: SMEAGOL peers over his shoulder . . . the GOLD
reflects in SMEAGOL'S EYES!

ON SOUNDTRACK: The HUM of the RING growing LOUDER . . .

<b>                     SMEAGOL
</b>           Give us that, Deagol, my love!

DEAGOL turns to look at him, a smirk on his face.

<b>                      DEAGOL
</b>           Why?

CLOSE ON: SMEAGOL moves towards DEAGOL . . .

<b>                     SMEAGOL
</b>           Because its my birthday, and I wants it.

ANGLE ON: SMEAGOL jumps on DEAGOL . . . STRANGLING HIM! SMEAGOL
rips the GLITTERING RING from DEAGOL'S LIMP HAND.

                      SMEAGOL (cont'd)
           My precious!

CLOSE ON: SMEAGOL slips the RING onto his FINGER and DISAPPEARS.

</b>
<b>INT. MISTY MOUNTAINS CAVES - DAY
</b>
IMAGES: SMEAGOL descending into madness. His body TWISTS and
DISTORTS . . . he becomes a CREEPY, SHRIVELLED wretch . . . finally
crawling into a DARK CAVE beneath the MISTY MOUNTAINS.

<b>                     SMEAGOL V/0
</b>           They cursed us. Murderer. Murderer they
           called us. They cursed us and drove us
           away.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>                        SMEAGOL V/0 (cont'd)
             And we wept, Precious, we wept to be so
             alone. And we forgot the taste of bread,
             the sound of trees, the softness of the
             wind . . . We even forgot our own name.
                  (in a choking cough)
             Gollum! Gollum!

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM in the CAVE staring at the RING in his hand.

<b>                        GOLLUM
</b>             It's mine! My own. It came to me.

<b>                        SMEAGOL
</b>                  (ecstatic)
             My Precious.

<b>                                                        DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. CULVERT, VALE OF MORGUL - DAWN
</b>
ANGLE ON: A GRIM LANDSCAPE, covered in THORN BUSHES and the
scars of RECENT FIRES. The DARK MORGUL VALLEY disappears up
towards the MOUNTAINS.

SETTLE ON: FRODO and SAM in a FILTHY CULVERT.
SAM twitches in a RESTLESS SLEEP. But FRODO is awake . . . His
hand trails down to the CHAIN around his NECK ...

A SUDDEN HISS! FRODO quickly hides the RING as GOLLUM peers
at them with GLEAMING EYES.

<b>                        GOLLUM
</b>             Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We
             must go, yes, we must go at once!

SAM STIRS, looks at FRODO . . .

<b>                        SAM
</b>             Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo?

FRODO shakes his HEAD.

                        SAM (cont'd)
             I've gone and had too much!

SAM looks at the dead, BROWN TWILIGHT, below the LOWERING
<b>CLOUD.
</b>
                        SAM (cont'd)
             It must be getting late.

<b>                        FRODO
</b>             No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
             The days are growing darker.

The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE
ECHOES down the VALLEY.

<b>                        GOLLUM
</b>             Come on, must go, no time ...

<b>                        SAM
</b>             Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.

<b>                        GOLLUM
</b>             . . . no time to lose, silly.

SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage in
his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD to
<b>FRODO.
</b>
<b>                        SAM
</b>             Here.

<b>                        FRODO

<b>                        SAM
</b>                  (lying badly)
             I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas
             bread.

<b>                        FRODO
</b>             Sam.

<b>                        SAM
</b>                  (confessing)
             Alright. We don't have that much left.

            We have to be careful or we're going to run
            out. You go ahead and eat that, Mr Frodo.
            I've rationed it. There should be enough.

FRODO looksa t SAM questioningly.

<b>                        FRODO
</b>            For what?

<b>                       SAM
</b>            The journey home.

FRODO says nothing.                                            .

<b>EXT. CULVERT, VALE OF MORGUL - DAY
</b>
WIDE: FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM as he leads them on the
wining, torturous path ... clambering through BRACKEN and
over JAGGED ROCKS.

<b>                       GOLLUM
</b>            Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close
            to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry!
            Shhh.

<b>EXT. THE FOREST OF ISENGARD. DAY
</b>
GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN and GIMLI through
dark woodland . . .

The MOVING FOREST of FANGORN ...opens before them . . .
creating an AVENUE of TREES, which allows them access along
the old ISENGARD ROAD. A THICK, HUMID MIST fills the forest.

<b>ISENGARD.
</b>
<b>EXT. ISENGARED GATE - DAY

Far off, half veiled int he swirling STEAM, the TOWER of
ORTHANC stands ... Unbroken by the storm. Pale waters lap
about its feet.

ANGLE ON: TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL
. . . MERRY and PIPPIN! SPREAD before them is a feast of
BREADS, MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie
back in the SUN.

<b>                       PIPPIN

<b>                       MERRY

           be managed here ... Locked in his tower.

           No. He has no power any more.

THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely . . .

<b>                       TREEBEARD
</b>           The filth of Saruman is washing away ...
           Trees will come back to live here, young
           trees . . . wild trees.

RELUCTANTLY, PIPPIN hands the PALANTIR to GANDALF ... who

GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN.

                    ARAGORN (cont'd)
          Every day Frpdo moves closer to Mordor.

GANDALF watches his friend's face . . . seeking reassurance.

          Yes - yes, he is alive.

<b>EXT. MORGUL VALLEY - NIGHT

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
             Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

SMEAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the
SLEEPING figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off his ROCK
. . . silently sidling towards the EDGE of a STAGNANT POOL.

PIPPIN gasps with FRIGHT! MERRY is sitting up, wiping sleep
from his eyes. He moves on . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
             saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
             enemy's plan.

GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
             Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
             our enemy one thing.

The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN . . .

             The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
             not as weak as he supposed. There is
             courage still - strength enough left to

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE . . .

ANGLE ON: Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin,
its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out-
thrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.

With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it
seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth.

Suddenly the SUN climbs over the eastern hills,     and sends
forth a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against th    e face of the

ANGLE ON: The stares of frightened GONDORIANS as GANDALF and
PIPPIN gallop through the WINDING STREETS . . .

AERIAL SHOT: SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up
towards the 7th LEVEL.

MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS - each behind a CIRCULAR
DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises - the city reaches a height
of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL.

A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK - shaped like a sharp
ship's prow - bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP.

<b>EXT. MINAS TIRITH, COURT OF THE KINGS - DAY

SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the
CITY - 1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS.

GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the
CITADEL to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off . . .

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN as he takes in his surroundings, his eye
caught by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT,
FOUR SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it.

GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES,

             Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
             Boromir's father. To give him news of his
             beloved son's death would be most unwise
             ... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the

<b>INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL - DAY
</b>
ANGLE ON: A LONG SOLEMN HALL ... with ROWS OF BLACK MARBLE
PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL
KINGS carved in cold STONE.

GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following
obediently behind.

At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE,
EMPTY THRONE . . . and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a
FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.

At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of
<b>CONDOR.

DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

           Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
           now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
           North - last of a ragged house, long bereft

closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN
follows.

FRODO falls to the GROUND.

AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING

FRODO and SAM sink to the ground, holding their hands against

<b>EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS - NIGHT
</b>
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM following GOLLUM up the dizzying
STAIRWAY, carved into the SHEER CLIFF.

The STEPS are NARROW, UNEVENLY SPACED, and many are BROKEN.
They are so STEEP that FRODO and SAM climb as if on a LADDER �
their desperate FINGERS clinging to the STEPS ABOVE - trying
not to look at the LONG BLACK FALL below them.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S foot slips and for a brief moment he is
HANGING PRECARIOUSLY from the ROCK-FACE.

</b>            Careful, Master - careful! Very far to

ANGLE ON: SAM'S horrified face as . . .

GOLLUM'S out-stretched HAND suddenly GRASPS FRODO'S ARM
pulling him SAFELY onto the LEDGE.

GOLLUM glares down at SAM.

their heavy pale lids.

ear:

           He   wants it - he needs it. Smeagol sees it

           it   from you.

CLOSE ON: FRODO looking at SAM . . . his hand strays to his

SAM watches a sleeping GOLLUM suspiciously as he desperately
tries to stay awake. SLOWLY, INEVITABLY, SAM, falls asleep.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S EYES SNAP OPEN . . . he sits up and quietly
crawls towards SAM'S KNAPSACK.

SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep.

GOLLUM grimaces in DISTASTE as he pulls out the LEMBAS BREAD

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM as he throws the remaining LEMBAS BREAD over
the cliff.

             polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that
             nobody else could find and they say
             "Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh

           Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my

GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that
mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT
and INTO the MOUNTAIN.

             Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
             Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the

             It is but a shadow and a thought that you

<b>                       LEGOLAS
</b>             One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of

SUPPLIES. He is wearing an OVERSIZED HELMET and ROHIRRIM
CLOTHING . . . he looks at once NERVOUS and EXCITED.

KING THEODEN breaks away from a COLUMN and rides up to MERRY.

The ORC CATAPULTS do not fire rocks ...

HORROR sweeps through the streets of MINAS TIRITH as the
SEVERED HEADS of FARAMIR'S HORSEMEN land amongst the

DENETHOR looks down at FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY . . .

<b>                      DENETHOR

75,000 ORCS are spread out across the PELENNOR FIELDS like a
sea of black ANTS.

CLOSE ON: TROLLS load the CATAPULTS with ROCKS.

BATTERING RAMS and SIEGE TOWERS are hauled on CHAINS.
Thousands of flickering TORCHES give the army the look of a
moving city in the MURKY MORDOR TWILIGHT.

CLOSE ON: DENETHOR . . . struggling to regain the power of
speech!

CLOSE ON: A BOULDER smashes into a BALCONY full of CIVILIANS.

CONFUSION and PANIC spreads amongst the SOLDIERS.

QUICK CUTS: MIGHTY WOODEN CATAPULTS positioned within the
walls of MINAS TIRITH are fired!

The NAZGUL circle LOW over the CITY, like VULTURES seeking
doomed men's flesh. SOLDIERS are plucked into the AIR by
SHRIEKING NAZGUL and dropped to their DEATHS hundreds of FEET
BELOW. TOWERS and BUILDINGS are DESTROYED. CHAOS as SOLDIERS,
WOMEN and CHILDREN DODGE falling MASONRY.

             Not at the towers! Aim for the trolls! Kill
             the trolls! Bring them down!

TOO LATE! The TOWERS reach the walls, their DOORS crashing
down, releasing ORCS directly onto the LOWER LEVELS.

As the ORC swarm from the TOWER, GANDALF realises PIPPIN has
come down from the CITADEL . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             Peregrin Took - go .back to the citadel!

GANDALF intercepts the BEAST, striking him with his STAFF ...

GANDALF welds his STAFF, cutting through the attacking ORC
with EASE ... BEHIND him, an ORC prepares to cut down GANDALF
... PIPPIN instinctively slashes his SWORD at him.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF turns on PIPPIN, smiling despite himself.

<b>EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL, TUNNEL MOUTH - DAY

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM leads FRODO up a LONG RAVINE between COLUMNS
of TORN and WEATHERED ROCK.

AHEAD is a GREAT GREY WALL, a last huge mass of mountain-
stone . . . and in the SHADOWS at the base of the TOWERING ROCK
lies a TUNNEL.

FRODO reacts to the FOUL STENCH coming out of the BLACK HOLE.

over his hooded eyes ...

Drawing a DEEP BREATH, FRODO follows GOLLUM into the TUNNEL.

LOW ANGLE ON: The LIGHT instantly REVEALS a HUGE LOATHSOME
SPIDER . . . towering over FRODO!

CLOSE ON: SHELOB the SPIDER HISSES at the LIGHT! TWO great
clusters of many-windowed EYES protrude from her bulbous
head. Her LEGS are bent, with a 12 FOOT SPAN and HAIRS that
stick out like steel spines. Her HUGE, SWOLLEN BODY, a vast
bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. Her age-old
BLACK HIDE is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with LIVID MARKS
. . . but her belly underneath is PALE and LUMINOUS.

SHELOB beats the air with her FORELEGS.

ANGLE ON: Calling up all his remaining STRENGTH and
RESOLUTION, FRODO forces his LEGS to MOVE . . . he backs away -
keeping his EYES on SHELOB.

SHELOB crawls SLOWLY towards him ... then, with sudden .
hideous SPEED, she ATTACKS!

She lashes out with her FRONT LEGS ... FRODO is flung back
... the GLASS PHIAL clatters to the TUNNEL FLOOR, casting an
eerie LOW LIGHT.

SHELOB squats above FRODO, her EYE CLUSTERS fidgeting with
hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope
of escape.

SUDDENLY! FRODO draws STING! He slashes wildly at the GIANT
SPIDER . . . hewing off the TIP of A LEG!

SHELOB SPASMS . . . a WILD BLUR of thrashing LEGS!

ANGLE ON: FRODO leaps to his feet and RUNS - not even pausing
to pick up the PHIAL of LIGHT!

TRACKING BACK: with FRODO as he careers blindly down NARROW
TUNNELS, gasping in the CHOKING AIR ... looking back over his
shoulder for any sign of SHELOB.

ANGLE ON: FRODO sees the TUNNEL EXIT ahead . . .

. . . just as he runs straight into a great COBWEB!

SPINS AROUND: Before he can react, SHELOB VICIOUSLY STABS
FRODO in the NECK with her monstrous abdominal STINGER!

GREEN OOZE trickling from her WOUNDED EYE.

With HIND LEGS, SHELOB picks SAM off the ground and TOSSES
him BACKWARDS! SAM lands heavily . . . and SHELOB POUNCES!

down on him, SAM lifts the ELVEN BLADE above his head,

GORGOROTH PLATEAU - the mountain is erupting streams of ASH
and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of
MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH.

With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep

             There is still hope for Frodo. He needs
             time and safe passage across the Plains of

40 MILES AWAY, MOUNT DOOM rises out of the PLAIN . . . its feet
founded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great
height, where its reeking head is swathed in cloud.

             I don't think there will be a return
             journey, Mr Frodo.

A moment of EYE CONTACT between FRODO and SAM as they
acknowledge what lies ahead.

SAM offers FRODO his hand . . . and PULLS HIM UP.

WIDE ON: FRODO and SAM staggering across the TORTURED
LANDSCAPE ... they are no longer WEARING the ORC ARMOUR.

CLOSE ON: FRODO is walking half-bowed, often stumbling . . . as
if his eyes not longer see the way before his feet.

His right HAND is pressed against his CHEST ... supporting a
HEAVY WEIGHT. His left HAND often rises, as if to ward off
some invisible blow. SAM watches him, CONCERN etched across
his FACE . . .

CLOSE ON: FRODO as a malevolent VOICE in his head calls to
him . . . "Baggins - Baggins" . . .

SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN ride behind, leading FRODO'S EMPTY
<b>PONY.

<b>                       BILBO O.S.
</b>                (frail)
           Tell me again, lad. Where are we going?

<b>                      FRODO O.S.
</b>           To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves have
           accorded you a special honour. A place on
           the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

<b>INT. WAGON - DAY
</b>
CLOSE ON: FRODO is SITTING in the WAGON . . . his ARM around
his UNCLE BILBO.

BILBO is extremely OLD and FRAIL. He is DOZING . . . his head
slumped.

BILBO'S eyes flutter OPEN . . . with effort he raises his head


<b>                        BILBO
</b>                  (frail)
             Frodo ... Any chance of seeing that old
             ring of mine ... the one I gave you?

<b>                        FRODO
</b>                  (quietly)
             Sorry, Uncle . . . I'm afraid, I lost it.

<b>                        BILBO
</b>                  (frail)
             Oh . . . pity. I should like to have held it
             one last time.                                   �

BILBO nods back to sleep ... FRODO rests his head against
him.

<b>EXT. THE GREY HAVENS - DUSK

ANGLE ON: FRODO, walking arm-in-arm with BILBO through a
beautiful ELVEN BOAT-HOUSE ... GANDALF follows with MERRY,
PIPPIN and SAM.

hm . . .
 i

<b>                        BILBO
</b>             Oh! Well, here's a sight I have never�seen
             before.

TRACKING: Passing under a beautiful ELVEN ARCHWAY . . .

. . . to reveal a WHITE SHIP, ready to depart from a WHITE
<b>STONE DOCK.
</b>
ANGLE ON: ELROND, CELEBORN and GALADRIEL are waiting for
them.

The SETTING SUN slowly dropping behind the SEA ... visible
between the HEADLANDS of a beautiful INLET.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>

The lighting is beautiful . . . S U N streams through the sails,
casting an ethereal glow on THE GROUP as they walk onto the
<b>DOCK.
</b>
BILBO bows in acknowledgement to ELROND, CELEBORN and
GALADRIEL, who return his GREETING.

<b>                       GALADRIEL
</b>             The power of the Three Rings is ended. The
             time has come for the Dominion of Men.

<b>                        ELROND
</b>                  (ELVISH: with subtitles)
             I Aear can ven na mar.

             T he Sea calls us ho me.


ELROND holds out his ARMS to BILBO who suddenly seems MUCH
YOUNGER and SPRIGHTLIER . . . He sets off down the PATH TOWARD
his HOSTS . . .

<b>                        BILBO
</b>             I think I'm quite ready for another
             adventure.

BILBO walks down toward the BOAT and BOARDS with ELROND . . .

ANGLE ON: FRODO looks up . . . GALADRIEL is watching him. She
SMILES, TURNS and BOARDS the BOAT . . .

GANDALF kneels before SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN - who are all
looking TEARFUL.

<b>                       GANDALF
</b>             Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now
             finished. Here at last, on the shores of
             the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship.

There is GREAT SADNESS . . . MERRY SNIFFLES LOUDLY.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             I will not say: "do not weep", for not all
             tears are an evil.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF turns and walks away . . . FRODO is DOWNCAST
... SUDDENLY, GANDALF turns and looks toward him.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           It is time, Frodo.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks at FRODO then turns and slowly walks
towards the GANGPLANK to board the SHIP.

<b>                      SAM
</b>                (alarmed)
           What does he mean?

CLOSE ON: FRODO turns to SAM. . . .

<b>                       FRODO
</b>                (gently)
           We set out to save the Shire, and it has
           been saved ... but not for me . . .

<b>                       SAM
</b>                (shaken)
           You don't mean that - you can't leave.

ANGLE ON: SAM looks down . . . FRODO is holding BILBO'S RED
JOURNAL out towards him.

<b>                      FRODO
</b>           The last pages are for you, Sam.

SAM is SOBBING . . . MERRY and PIPPIN are DISTRAUGHT . . . .

FRODO hugs MERRY and PIPPIN, and last of all SAM . . . and
climbs on board the SHIP.

ANGLE ON: FRODO a look of WONDERMENT crosses his face . . . as
he STEPS FORWARD and ACCEPTS GANDALF'S HAND . . . finally
released from his pain, care falls from his face . . . he is
the young FRODO we first met so long ago.

SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN comfort each other as the WHITE SHIP
glides away from the DOCK ...

WIDE ON: The WHITE BOAT sails away towards the HEADLANDS,
disappearing into the GOLDEN LIGHT of the SETTING SUN.

ANGLE ON: SAM in growing darkness, still follows the
departing SHIP with his eyes, MERRY and PIPPIN are already
preparing to leave.

<b>                                                           CUT TO:

<b>EXT. NO.3 BAGSHOT ROW - MORNING
</b>
ANGLE ON: SAM walks up the path towards his house . . .

A LITTLE GIRL toddles up to greet him.

<b>                       SAM
</b>            Elanor!

He hugs his daughter . . .

<b>                       FRODO V/0
</b>            My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in
            two. You have to be one and whole for many
            years. You have so much enjoy and to be and
            to do. Because Sam, your part in the
            journey goes on.

ANGLE ON: ROSIE COTTON steps up and kisses SAM on the cheek
. . . she gives him a TINY BABY BOY to cradle.

<b>                       SAM
</b>            Hello, little Frodo!

ANGLE ON: SAM with his FAMILY . . . he draws a deep breath:

                      SAM (cont'd)
           Well ... I'm back.

SAM looks at his LOVELY FAMILY with GREAT HAPPINESS, tinged
with a little SADNESS . . .

SAM and ROSIE take the CHILDREN'S HANDS and enter BAGSHOT . . .
the BRIGHT YELLOW DOORWAY closes behind them.
