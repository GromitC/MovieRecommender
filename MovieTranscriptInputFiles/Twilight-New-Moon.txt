<b>                      TWILIGHT: NEW MOON
</b>



                          Written By

                       Melissa Rosenberg




                    Adapted from the Novel by

                         Stephenie Meyer





                                             Dec. 21, 2008


<b>CREDITS OVER:                                                   
</b>
A FULL MOON FILLS THE FRAME -- Luminous, tinged with gold.      
Slowly, a penumbral shadow begins to spread across the          
moon's surface, darkening it from left to right...              

<b>                            BELLA (V.O.)
</b>                "These violent delights have violent
                ends..."

... until the moon is enveloped in shadow; a new moon...        
which disappears into the darkness.                             

OVER BLACK - A RUFFLED TULIP appears, isolated against the      
blackness.                                                      
<b>                            BELLA (V.O.)                        
</b>                "... And in their triumph die, like             
                fire and powder..."                             

HOLD ON the tulip as the background FADES UP around it to       
reveal we're now in --                                          

<b>EXT. FOREST - ECU ON THE TULIP - DAY                            
</b>
It's surrounded by the dark, lush, greenery of the forest       
floor.                                                          

<b>                            BELLA (V.O.)
</b>                "... Which, as they kiss, consume..."           

SUDDENLY A FOOT SLAMS DOWN next to the tulip, nearly            
crushing it. As the foot immediately lifts off again, it        
grazes the tulip, knocking its petals off --                    

<b>ON THE RUNNING PAIR OF FEET                                     
</b>They abruptly change direction. Race on. INCLUDE BELLA          
SWAN, desperately searching the woods -- SHORT, SURREAL CUTS    
of her frenetic quest --

<b>                           BELLA
</b>                Edward!

Ahead, through the darkness of the thick forest, she SEES       
SUNLIGHT; a clearing. She hurtles toward it --

<b>EXT. MEADOW - DAY
</b>
<b>                           BELLA
</b>                Edward!
<b>
</b><b>                                                             2.
</b>


-- as Bella bursts into the sunlight. It's the meadow where        
Edward revealed his skin in the sun. But he's not here now.        
Instead, Bella SEES --

ACROSS THE MEADOW -- AN OLD WOMAN, white hair framing her
withered face. Bella's eyes widen with surprise as she
recognizes --

<b>                           BELLA
</b>              ... Gran?

GRAN looks as surprised as Bella. Bella smiles and waves,
as does Gran. Bella starts toward her but --

<b>                           EDWARD (O.S.)
</b>              Bella...
She spins to the voice behind her to SEE --

EDWARD emerge from the forest, his alabaster skin in sharp         
contrast to the shadows. She beams at him, relieved, in
love... until he moves to edge of the shade, inches from
sun's rays --                                                      

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              Stop - she'll see!

But Edward just smiles and steps into the sunlight.                
Sunbeams SHATTER off his skin like a thousand rainbow              
shards, as if he were made of diamonds. An awesome sight.

JUMP CUT TO: Edward now inches from Bella, still glistening,
entrancing her. She wraps an arm around his waist, then
arranges her face into a calm expression. They turn to --          

Gran, whose expression is calm, too. Gran's arm is
extended, as if she also holds someone.
JUMP CUT TO: Bella and Edward, only feet from Gran now.
Bella's about to present Edward, but then SEES that --

Gran mimics Bella's movement exactly. With growing horror,
Bella reaches out to Gran... and touches glass!                    

PULL BACK TO FIND Gran is now surrounded by a GILDED FRAME.        
It's a MIRROR, mounted on a wall with wallpaper reflecting a       
surreal dreamlike version of the forest behind Bella.              

<b>                           BELLA
</b>              Oh my God.

-- as she realizes that's not Gran; it's Bella, sixty-five         
years older.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            3.
</b>

Bella spins to her perfect, eternally 17-year-old Edward.
He takes her now WRINKLED, age-spotted hand. Kisses it.

Then he leans in very close to her 83-YEAR-OLD FACE and           
whispers into her ear --                                          

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              Happy birthday.

<b>                                                  SMASH TO:       
</b>
<b>INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
ON BELLA - her eyes snap open. She lies atop her bed. A
book, "ROMEO AND JULIET," lays open on her chest. Bella
sits up, the dream still weighing on her...
INCLUDE HER ROOM, cluttered with pictures of Edward, of the       
Cullens; memorabilia of all things Edward. A KNOCK on the
door. CHIEF CHARLIE SWAN enters carrying two gifts, one
wrapped, one not.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>              Happy birthday, Bells.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              Dad, we agreed, no gifts.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>              At least mine's not wrapped.

He hands it to her. It's a digital camera.   Bella's
pleased, despite herself.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              Okay, this is actually kind of great.
              Thanks, Dad.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>                   (re: wrapped gift)
              Goes with this one from your mom. We
              coordinated - well, she coordinated
              me.

Bella opens the wrapped gift to reveal a SCRAPBOOK.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>              To put your pictures in, record your
              senior year -- man, senior year.
              How'd you get so old so fast?

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              Not that old.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           4.
</b>


<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>              I don't know. Is that a wrinkle?

Bella races to the mirror, searches her face.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>              I was kidding.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              So not funny, Dad.

<b>EXT. FORKS HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
An AERIAL VIEW of this lush, green, overcast landscape; the
rainy world that is Forks. FIND Bella's old truck as it
lumbers down the two-lane highway...
<b>                          BELLA (V.O.)
</b>              It was just a dream... but also my
              worst nightmare.                                   

<b>EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
Bella climbs out of her truck, shouldering her book bag.
She looks around the parking lot, seeking Edward --              

<b>                          MIKE (O.S.)
</b>              Wherefore art thou, Bella?

She turns as MIKE, ERIC, ANGELA and JESSICA approach.

<b>                          MIKE
</b>              You finish the Shakespeare assignment?

<b>                          JESSICA
</b>              He means will you finish his
              assignment?
<b>                          MIKE
</b>              No, I don't -- okay I do.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              I can help you with it -- but first --
                   (pulling out her camera)
              I need a picture. My mom's expecting
              a scrapbook full of memories.

<b>                          ANGELA
</b>                   (holds up her own camera)
              I take `em, I don't pose for `em.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              You do today.                                      
<b>
</b><b>                                                          5.
</b>


She pushes Angela to the others; they arrange themselves --     

<b>                          JESSICA
</b>              You'll photoshop my nose if it looks              
              big, right?                                       

<b>                          ERIC
</b>              Don't worry, I'm in the picture; no
              one will be looking at you guys.

Jessica scoffs, Angela points her camera at Bella; Mike and
Eric joust -- Bella aims --                                     

<b>FULL FRAME - THE CAMERA'S DIGITAL SCREEN                        
</b>
It FREEZES on them, fun, delightfully carefree... but when      
the camera lowers, their playfulness has dissipated as they     
see someone behind Bella. She turns to see --                   

EDWARD climbing out of his silver Volvo.

<b>                         MIKE

Then he kisses her, tenderly, adoringly. She kisses him         
back... despite their restraint, the passion mounts... until
he pulls away. As always, both are left wanting more.

JACOB BLACK, 16, jogs up, carrying a used car part, long,
black ponytail wagging. He looks 18 due to his tall,
muscular body, but the gregarious Jacob is a little klutzy,     
still catching up to his growth spurt. He nods to Edward,
who moves off to the side but eyes them.

dangling from it. He hands it to her.

resentment. Jacob holds his gaze.

wrapped gift appears in Bella's face. ALICE presents it.

Over Alice's shoulder, Bella sees JASPER, keeping his
distance. He offers her a pleasant nod. She tries to hide       
Alice's present, hoping no one noticed --

INCLUDE -- Edward and Bella (now wearing a green dress).
She studies the painting - the largest on a wall crowded
with pictures. The other walls are towering bookshelves.

</b>              Francesco Solimena painted this; he
              often depicted the Volturi as Gods.

              decades. He describes them as very                  
              refined - for killers.

<b>PUSH IN ON THE PAINTING, THE FOURSOME
</b>
Their features begin to fill in, become real - THEY COME TO
LIFE in the painting, turning to leave the balcony through
an archway. We FOLLOW THEM into --

<b>INT. A CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL - DAY
</b>
It's centuries old, its marble cracked and weathered. The         
open oculus in the domed ceiling is the only source of            
light. The room is empty but for three large wooden chairs        
and half a dozen VAMPIRES in elegant 18th century attire.

              secret the existence of our kind.                   

Two of the Volturi, MARCUS and CAIUS, take their seats,           
Carlisle stands beside them. ARO moves to the center of the       
room where we REVEAL --                                           

A ROGUE VAMPIRE is on his knees. He looks feral compared to       
the others, and terrified. Aro puts his hands on either           
side of the Rogue's face. Compassion?

              or kill conspicuously, unless we want               
              to die.

Aro then slowly, dispassionately, RIPS THE ROGUE'S HEAD OFF.      
Two Volturi Guards (FELIX and DEMETRI) appear on either           
side, holding him down as Aro easily detaches the head and        
tosses it aside. Aro calmly sits as the others tear the           
Rogue limb from limb. Carlisle has to look away...

wrapped gifts, a huge cake and a tall stack of china plates.

an empty car-radio box.

CLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGER - A single drop of deep red blood
appears.

Bella thinks little of it, but then HEARS a disturbing,            
grisly SNARL -- she looks up just as --

CRASH into the table, plates shattering as --

-- Edward pushes him, hard; Jasper SAILS backward, hitting         
the wall. But he RICOCHETS off it and comes back at Bella.

Then everybody's eyes snap toward Bella as they catch the
overwhelming scent --

ON BELLA - lying amid the shards of broken china. She looks
at her arm, seeing now - it's been slashed by plate shards;
bright red blood pulses out of her, pooling. She looks up --

<b>BELLA'S POV - THE CULLENS (SLOW MOTION)

All of them now, including Edward (but not Carlisle) stare
down at her, at her blood, with fevered eyes. Six suddenly
ravenous vampires...

side. Edward, though white as a bone, snaps out of it and
stands between her and the others.

examines Bella's arm.

Edward looks from him to Bella. Then steps back, allowing
Carlisle to lift Bella and carry her to the kitchen. But
just before the kitchen door closes, Bella sees Edward's

He climbs out - instantly he's opening the passenger side       
door for her. She climbs out. He looks down at her face -       
he softens as he takes it in. Puts a hand on her cheek.

He lifts her face to his, and kisses her. He begins               
carefully, gently... but it changes, he becomes urgent, with      
an almost painful edge, as if it were goodbye.                    

Abruptly, he pulls away. With a last look, he turns walks         
off into the night. Off Bella...

He stands by the house. Bella hurries toward him, but slows
when she sees his cold, distant face; an unreadable mask.

Edward gently takes her hand. Dread fills her, but she lets
him guide her toward the woods...

Bella looks at him.   His hard face.   His resolve.

Tears sting Bella's eyes. This can't be happening. He
steps forward... kisses her forehead. She closes her eyes.

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              I promise, it will be like I never

And here, for the first time, we SEE how truly agonizing
this really is for Edward. But Bella doesn't see.                     

By the time she opens her eyes - he's gone.    She spins --           

<b>                           BELLA
</b>              -- Wait --

She SEES a LEAF FLITTERING to the ground where he grazed a            
branch; the only indication of his direction. She hurries             
down the path, then runs --

Bella runs through the woods, searching, reminiscent of her

night -- HEAR Bella's sharp desperate BREATHS --                 

BELLA TRIPS. Falls to the damp forest floor.        She looks up,     
the trees spinning around her...

shrouding her. Devastation paralyzing her.                            

ECU ON HER FACE - numb. HEAR the faint sound of her name              
being called in the distance. A search party. She's too               
wrecked to respond.

Rain begins to pour; she doesn't register it....

SERIES OF SCENES END ON -- BELLA, lying there, dazed. She
begins to HEAR an animal SNUFFLING. It gets closer. It
sounds large. Scary. Then she hears a whisper --

She lifts her head, looks for Edward... but SEES something         
else instead --

BELLA'S POV - A DARK SHAPE, huge, black. Nearing. Its EYES
reflect light for a split second; they're inhuman, savage.

Bella, terrified, manages to DRAG herself to a cluster of
trees. She squeezes between them. Breathing hard. She
closes her eyes, trying to disappear...

Half the town is gathered - a tired rescue party that
includes Mike Newton and Jacob Black.

Charlie, beside himself with worry, pores over a map with
BILLY BLACK (in wheelchair) and Quileute HARRY CLEARWATER,

SAM ULEY, 20, emerges, a tall, strong Quileute Indian with       
cropped hair and a fierce expression. He's carrying Bella.

</b>              It's Sam Uley. He found her.

Charlie bolts to her; he's never moved faster in his life.
He wraps his arms around Bella, lifting her from Sam's arms.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>              Thank you, Sam. Thank God.

Charlie carries Bella to the house, cradling her. Harry and      
Billy give Sam a nod of praise and gratitude. But Sam backs      
away, avoiding any accolades.

ON JACOB - jogging alongside Charlie, peering at Bella with      
worry. Then Jacob slows, feeling eyes on his back... he          
turns to SEE Sam Uley staring at him. Jacob, uncomfortable,
quickly looks away.

Then at its foot. Under the blankets. On top of them. In

A BLACK LIQUID begins to flood the floor, slowly swallowing      
everything in the room. It rises up the sides of the bed,

Bella and Jessica exit the theater.   A MARQUEE behind them      
bears the title of a ZOMBIE film.

              going through things, too. Like Mike
              deciding he wanted to "just be friends?"
              That was really hard and --

<b>                          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>              How `bout a ride, girls?

As Bella looks ACROSS THE STREET, time suddenly SLOWS --

<b>BELLA'S POV - A DIVE BAR, "ONE EYED PETE'S" (SLOW MOTION)
</b>
-- FOUR ROUGH-LOOKING GUYS loiter out front next to their           
motorcycles. They're in shadow, we can't see their faces.

<b>OFF BELLA WE SMASH TO --
</b>
FLASHPOPS: Bella surrounded by FOUR GUYS ("Twilight");
Edward's Volvo skidding to a stop; Edward staring them down --

BACK ON BELLA, a chill going down her spine, FREEZING her as
she stares at the foursome across the street...

Then suddenly -- a pair of lips lean next to her ear --

<b>                          EDWARD (O.S.)
</b>              Move, Bella.

She turns to find Edward standing next to her. Or so it
seems. But he's an illusion; an apparition - which becomes          
clear when --

Jessica steps right into him, dissolving him to nothingness, and
<b>TIME ABRUPTLY SPEEDS UP AGAIN --
</b><b>                           JESSICA
</b>              Come on.

<b>                          JESSICA
</b>              Can we just go --

Jessica pulls at her arm, but Bella shakes her off.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              I want to see something.

</b>


Much to Jessica's frustration, Bella begins to cross the
street toward the Guys, frightened but drawn.

<b>                          GUY #1
</b>              Alright, we got a taker.

The apparition of EDWARD REAPPEARS in her path this time.           
She stops.

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              Turn around, Bella.     This is                       
              dangerous.                                            

But when she steps backward, he fades. Testing her
hallucination, she strides forward again -- Edward's
apparition reappears, strides alongside her --
<b>                             EDWARD
</b>              Stop.   Now.

She's almost smiling as she reaches the Guys, finally able
to see them clearly -- and stops, realizing --

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              ... You're not them.                                  

And with that.... Edward disappears.

<b>                          GUY #1
</b>              We'll be whoever you want, honey.

Guy #2 pulls up right next to her on his motorcycle.

<b>                          GUY #2
</b>              Ready for a thrill ride?

GUY #2 extends his hand to help her onto the bike.     She          
hesitates.

Edward's apparition appears on the other side of the bike.          
Bella looks at him with determination -- then climbs on to          
the back of the bike --

The bike LURCHES forward, going way too fast. As the wind            
blasts her hair back, she realizes this might have been a            
mistake --

Guy #2 doesn't hear her, guns the engine, going faster --            

<b>BELLA'S POV - DIRECTLY AHEAD                                         
</b>
Edward stands in road, directly in their path, more present,         
more clear than ever. The bike's headlight illuminates him,          
racing toward him --

</b>              Stop - stop! - STOP!                                   

The bike abruptly pulls up short.                                    

<b>                          GUY #2                                     
</b>              Hey, I didn't force nothing on you.                    

Bella scrambles off, stumbling in the process.    Edward is          
gone.                                                                

The four Guys then REV their bikes and PEEL out.    Bella            
watches them go as Jessica storms up.

<b>                          JESSICA

An angry Jessica charges off. Bella watches the motorcycles
disappear down the street as --

<b>                          BELLA (V.O.)
</b>              He wasn't real. I knew that. I                       
              didn't care. I needed to see him. If                 
              danger's what it took, that's what I'd               
              find.                                                

Off Bella, determination settling into her face...

<b>EXT. JACOB BLACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella pulls up in her truck, a tarp covering something big
in the back. Jacob comes out of the house. A huge grin.
<b>                          JACOB
</b>              Bella!

Bella hops out, Jacob gives her a hug.   Bella's surprised by
his affection, but doesn't mind.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              `Bout time you came by.

<b>                          BELLA

Bella pulls the tarp back, revealing - her neighbor's two
dilapidated, rusting MOTORCYCLES.

<b>                          JACOB

              When do we start?

Bella face spreads into something we haven't seen in a
while... a wide smile. As they pull the bikes off the
truck, they laugh and joke; it's as though Jacob has brought       
Bella back to life. But --

<b>UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND JACOB FROM A DISTANCE

-- someone's watching as the two of them wheel the bikes           
into the garage. REVERSE on the watcher to discover --

<b>EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS - SAM ULEY - SAME
</b>
Next to Sam stand two others, JARED, 17, and PAUL, 18. All
three have cropped hair, sleeveless shirts, cut-offs. It's
unsettling how they watch Bella and Jacob; the ferocity in
their eyes, the danger.
Sam turns; the others follow his lead. The three slink
soundlessly into the darkness of the woods...

RUSTLE. Nate stops. Then, from the opposite direction,
another RUSTLE. Then another, and another, from behind,

moving with extraordinary speed. The guys are terrified.

No answer.   He turns to find that Nate has vanished.

</b>               Nate?   Nate!?

Nothing... then the RUSTLING starts again.       And intensifies.

Tim BOLTS! CLOSE ON TIM - tearing through the woods, too
scared to feel the branches SMACK him in the face. Breath
ragged, he looks over his shoulder --

TIM'S POV - BEHIND HIM - something gives chase, flattening
foliage and bending thin trees in its path. Tim runs harder --

Tim bursts from the tree-line, he's almost to the pavement,       
he`s going to escape --

QUIL ATEARA and EMBRY CALL enter, both 16. Quil is short,
stocky and feisty, with short hair. Embry is tall, thin and
laid back, with chin-length black hair.

              Right. Quil took his cousin to prom.

Embry chuckles, as well.

<b>                          QUIL
</b>              Yeah, that's still a riot. You want
              funny, Black? I'll give you funny.

Quil makes a run at him, he dodges; a playful scuffle ensues.
Embry, amused, saunters over to Bella.

out.

He constantly touches her, playful, affectionate. It's            
effortless in contrast to Edward's intense restraint. We          
can see her spirits beginning to lift.

Bella TEARS through the forest, searching desperately. Then
she turns -- finds Edward a few yards away, his face cold.      
She steps toward him -- but he BOLTS backward, suddenly
twenty yards away --

Bella utterly alone, darkness closing in on her...

Bella SCREAMS in her sleep. The light turns on and Charlie      
hurries to her side, gently shaking her awake.

Her eyes open, tears streaming down her cheeks. He doesn't      
quite know what to do, so hands her a glass of water from       
her bedside table. She sits up, sips. He pulls the

</b>              He missed some school - then, out of
              nowhere, he's following Sam around.
              Same thing happened with Paul and
              Jared. They weren't even friends, now
              Sam owns them.

              Sam keeps giving me this look, like               
              he's waiting for me or something; it's            
              kinda freaking me out.

She sees he's unnerved, instinctively hugs him reassuringly.

Bella realizes she crossed a line and covers, playfully
shoving him. As they head to the truck, Bella looks back --

DIVES over the edge, cutting a clean line into the water.

She's lying. PULL BACK to see she's straddling the now
completed motorcycle. Jacob stands next to her, holding the
bike up. There's an intimacy to their proximity. INCLUDE --

<b>EXT. LA PUSH - CLEARING IN THE FOREST (CONTINUOUS) - DAY
</b>
The bike is aimed down a dirt road.     Jacob runs through the     
instructions:

<b>                          JACOB
</b>               Brake?
                    (she taps it)
               Clutch?
                    (she squeezes it)
               Right. Gas?
                    (she grips it)
               You ready?

Bella nods.   Jacob grins... then KICK-STARTS the bike.
<b>                           JACOB
</b>               Slowly... release the clutch.

She does... the bike moves forward an inch -- Jacob
cautiously steps back. She moves forward another inch --

<b>                             EDWARD (O.S.)
</b>               Stop.

Bella turns to find the apparition of EDWARD standing next
to her. Her hand slips off the clutch, the bike BUCKS and
falls on top of her. Jacob quickly lifts it off her as the         
apparition of Edward disappears.

<b>                            JACOB
</b>               You okay?   Bruises, breaks -- ?                    

<b>                           BELLA
</b>               I'm going again.

<b>                           JACOB
</b>               I'm not sure that's a good --
Bella quickly rises and hops back on.

<b>                           JACOB
</b>               Guess we're going again. Now what are
               you going to do with the clutch?

<b>                             BELLA
</b>               Release it.    Slowly.

Jacob nods. Then kick-starts the bike again. She releases
the clutch and moves forward. Slowly at first -- EDWARD
reappears at her side, glowering.

She keeps going, a little faster. EDWARD appears on her left     
now; she passes him. He reappears ahead; she passes.

ON BELLA'S FACE as the wind flings her hair back. She
gathers speed... and for a moment, experiences pure freedom,
exhilaration... then she sees Edward standing at the curve
in the road ahead, and realizes --

<b>                          BELLA
</b>                   (yelling to Jacob)
              I don't -- how do I turn!?

<b>                           JACOB
</b>              Bank it!   Bank - hit the brake!

Jacob races toward her. She reaches the turn, doesn't bank,
goes straight... and flies right into a wall of trees.

As she lies on the ground dazed, Jacob hurries up.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              What, are you training for the X-games?

She looks around for Edward.   He's gone.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              I want to go again.

<b>                          JACOB

              your head.                                         

Indeed, blood drips down her forehead. He pulls off his          
shirt to mop it up. She shrinks away --

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              It's just blood, Bella.

He bends over her, carefully tending her head. She finds
herself looking at him. His dark eyes, his bare chest and        
smooth skin. He glances at her.

He takes this in, it's hard. A wave of something sweeps
over him. He sits back. Closes his eyes, takes a breath.

the phone, waiting for it to ring. BEEEEP --

Bella's on the phone, leaving yet another message, her             
desperation having reached its peak. In the living room,           
Charlie and Harry check their fishing gear.

SERIES OF CUTS - Bella tries to navigate her way to the            
meadow. She refers to a map, a compass.                            

<b>                           BELLA (V.O.)                            
</b>               I was more afraid of the hole in my                 
               chest than I was of bears. Without

               ever...                                             

Bella tries a trail; it doesn't look familiar.    Backtracks.      
Tries another.

               him, or the feeling of him...                       

FLASHPOP - THE MEADOW - Edward and Bella lie in the grass          
surrounded by flowers, sunlight dappling them. They look           
lovingly into one another's eyes...                                

BACK ON BELLA - the memory and her desperation fuel her.           
Finally, she sees a clearing ahead, hurries toward it --           

<b>EXT. THE MEADOW (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Bella steps into the clearing, hopeful... but her face          
falls. In contrast to the warmth of her memory, the meadow         
is cold, gloomy, cloudy. And no Edward. She closes her             
eyes, trying to force Edward here.                                 

Nothing.   Her eyes open on the empty, overcast meadow.            

Bella sinks to her knees. Tears threatening. But then she
hears a RUSTLING noise. She turns toward it, peers into the
woods.                                                             

Another RUSTLING NOISE comes from another part of the woods.
She spins toward it -- nothing. Then she turns and JUMPS
when she finds --

Vampire LAURENT standing just ten yards away.    Dreadlocks,
chiseled face. Bella can't believe it.

</b>              I live here. But you - I thought you              
              were in Alaska with Carlisle's friend.

<b>                          LAURENT
</b>              Tanya, I was. It was kind of him to
              arrange, given my association with

Laurent begins to stroll in a slow arc around her, his eyes
assessing her as --

<b>                          LAURENT
</b>              I went to visit the Cullens, but their
              house is empty. I'm surprised they
              left you behind. Weren't you sort of
              a pet of theirs?

Bella's smile falters, fear beginning to dawn on her.           
<b>                          BELLA

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              I'll tell them you stopped by.

Edward fades (throughout, he'll reappear when he speaks,
then fade again). Bella tries to look relaxed.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              Will they be able to reach you in Alaska?

<b>                          LAURENT

              family was pleasant enough. But the
              dietary restrictions were difficult -
              living on nothing but animals.

Suddenly, he's standing inches from her.   She now sees his
EYES. Dark blood-red.

              compelled to... cheat?                                 

Bella involuntarily takes a step away from him.

<b>                          LAURENT
</b>              But that's not why I left. I came
              back here as a favor to Victoria.

<b>                          BELLA

              More or less. She asked me to get the                  
              lay of the land with the Cullens.
              Because, well... I'm afraid Victoria                   
              is quite put out with you.

<b>                          BELLA

<b>                          LAURENT
</b>              Yes. She feels it's only fair to kill
              Edward's mate, given he killed hers.
              Eye for an eye, mate for a mate.

And now Bella knows.   Terror overwhelms her.   Edward appears --

<b>                          EDWARD

<b>                          BELLA

                   (inhaling)
              And you smell so... mouth watering.

He faces her, taking in her scent, bloodlust building.   Her
eyes dart around, escape is impossible --

The only thing she SEES is the apparition of Edward, looking
at her with alarm...                                             

<b>                         BELLA

              Edward. I love you.                                
Laurent is milliseconds from biting - then abruptly, his         
expression changes. He sees something in the forest behind       
Bella - and it terrifies him.                                    

<b>                          LAURENT
</b>              I... don't believe it.

He steps back. Bella's confused as she realizes he's no
longer focused on her... she follows his eyes, slowly
turning... to find behind her --

AN ENORMOUS BLACK WOLF skulking out of the darkness of the       
woods. It stalks towards them, a low disturbing GROWL in
its throat, sharp teeth gleaming.
<b>

Bella is trapped between the two killers.    Edward whispers
in her ear --

<b>                           EDWARD
</b>              Don't.   Move.

The wolf slinks closer to Bella, a mere twenty feet from where     
she stands, then --

FOUR MORE WOLVES soundlessly emerge from the trees, flanking
the black wolf. They're the size of small horses, all of
different hues: dark silver, chocolate, ash and russet-            
brown. Their hackles are up, lips curling, bodies crouched,
ready to spring.                                                   

Bella is frozen with fear as they come toward her. The RUSSET-  
BROWN WOLF is the closest and looks directly at her. Laurent    
continues to retreat - then suddenly, almost simultaneously --  

-- Laurent BOLTS across the meadow --                              

-- The wolves SPRING toward Bella -- and leap right over her
in pursuit of Laurent! Their thunderous SNARLS and SNAPS
shake her as the pack sprint after the vampire, surrounding        
him before he reaches the treeline --                              

Laurent SWINGS at the dark silver wolf, SMACKING the wolf          
half-way across the meadow. Another wolf lunges at Laurent -       
he kicks it and it sails into a tree, SPLINTERING it.              

The two wolves recover, lurch back to the pack which closes        
in on Laurent. It's impossible to know who will prevail --         

Bella doesn't stay to find out.     She RACES into the woods --    

<b>EXT. WOODS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Bella runs franticly, tearing down the hillside,                
tripping, quickly picking herself up -- running, running --

on the shoulder. She jumps in, PEALS out --

Bella BURSTS in, out of breath. Charlie and Harry
Clearwater are washing their fishing gear. Charlie spins.

We might note, though they don't, that Harry Clearwater

              - and I ran.

Charlie grabs up the phone; as he dials --

Bella knocks.   Then knocks again.    Finally, Billy answers.

<b>                             BELLA
</b>                Hi, Billy.   I know Jacob's sick but --

<b>                            BILLY
</b>                I'll let him know you came by.

Billy starts to close the door, but Bella stops him.

<b>                            BELLA
</b>                Wait -- he's got mono, right?    That's

</b>                     (with compassion)
                You should go on home, Bella.

And he closes the door.      Off Bella --

<b>INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY
</b>
Bella climbs in, slams the door, pissed. Starts the truck.
Then turns it off. Deciding, she tosses the keys aside and         
sinks down into her seat to wait...

<b>BELLA'S POV - EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE - ON THE WINDOW - LATER
</b>
RAIN now pours down. Billy, inside, pulls the curtain back,
looks out at Bella with sympathy. Then closes the curtain.

<b>INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - ON BELLA - SAME
</b>
Bella looks out the passenger window at Billy. Suddenly,
there's a KNOCK at the driver's window. She spins to find --

JACOB standing there. But his face is shockingly different.
His hair is cropped short. No friendly smile.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           59.

No warmth in his eyes. Just a hard, brooding resentment.
Bella is taken aback. She climbs out of the truck to FIND --

<b>EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - DAY
</b>
-- behind Jacob stand Sam Uley, Jared, Paul and Embry.
They're oblivious to the rain, wear minimal clothes.              

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              You cut your hair.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              Go away.

Jacob turns away. Sam leads the group toward the house.
Jacob follows. She, and we, note his sure-footed strides;         
his awkward growth spurt disappeared overnight. She grabs         
his arm.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              What happened to you?

He stops, turns back. The others wait on the porch for him.
They're out of earshot, but won't leave him alone with her.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>                   (lowers her voice)
              I can help.

His face is hard as he shakes his head.   He's not talking.

<b>                          BELLA

breath, trying to calm himself.

<b>INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bella enters, dripping wet, too listless to close the door.       
Charlie's face falls when he sees the pain and lifelessness       
returned to her. He grabs a blanket, wraps her in it.

Bella TEARS through the forest again, searching. She turns --
finds Edward, cold, distant. But his face begins to MORPH...      

... and becomes Jacob's. She reaches for him but he BOLTS         
backward, suddenly many yards away.

He, too, retreats further, disappearing until Bella is alone.

BLACKNESS encroaches, the moonlight becoming a tiny
spotlight on her. She searches the dark - then SEES a pair
of EYES, female, blood-red - coming toward her; HEAR a loud
<b>SCREECHING NOISE --

realizes what he's about to attempt --

<b>EXT. LA PUSH - CLEARING IN THE FOREST - NIGHT

Bella parks. Climbs out of her truck. The moon eerily             
illuminates the clearing. Forest NOISES encroach.

She hears a RUSTLE amid the trees. Spooked, she freezes --        
then SEES JACOB emerge from the trees. A moment as their
eyes meet. Then --

Sam Uley, Paul, Embry and Jared step into the clearing, as        
well, half-clothed, movements almost synchronized. Their          
expressions simultaneously alter into fury when they see
Bella. Paul spins on Jacob.

Jacob DIVES headfirst into the air - with another sharp
TEARING sound, shreds of cloth blast into the air, fur
BURSTS from Jacob's skin - he lands on the ground a gigantic
russet-brown wolf, charging the Paul-wolf.                           

Bella reels as the two wolves CRASH into each other,                 
snarling and RAMMING one another. The sound is DEAFENING.
Their teeth flash at each other's throats.

Bella stumbles backward as the fight carries the two wolves          
beyond the clearing and into the woods --

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM, as they fight deeper and deeper into
the darkness... until they disappear. The horrible SOUNDS
of the fight still ECHO --

his shoes.

Bella hesitantly enters behind Jared and Embry. She sees            
EMILY, 20, at a counter, popping fresh muffins out of a tin.
SEE only one side of Emily's beautiful face, draped by long
black hair.

Emily looks toward them now -- REVEALING the other side of
her face: A scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines
that pull down her eye and twist her mouth.

He kisses Emily's scarred face adoringly. Bella has to look     
away. Their utter devotion is a painful reminder of what
she has lost. Fortunately, she's distracted by --

Jacob and Paul's arrival. They laugh and jab one another.
Bella is relieved to find Jacob unscathed. Jared and Embry
crowd them, finding a scar on Paul's arm --

As Jared reluctantly hands Embry five bucks, Jacob's eyes       
find Bella's. He nods solemnly to the door; we should talk.

</b>              James hated cars. He liked being
              close to the ground. But I'd steal                   
              one occasionally, to throw him off the
              scent... See, we played hide and seek

pretty bleach-blonde with expensive jewelry. She's just
coming to, a bump on her head where she was knocked out.

              So I'd let   him find me...

Denise now lucid, looks around to SEE --                           

IN THE BACK SEAT her husband, MICHAEL'S BODY, well-dressed
in a turtle neck, 40's, sits upright, his head tilted
forward as if he's resting. Denise reaches for him --

Denise, scared, shakes Michael's arm --

-- which causes Michael's head to roll to the side,
revealing his gouged, blood-soaked neck and his vacant, dead
eyes. Denise starts SCREAMING. Victoria grins.

She takes a last look at him... then with a running leap --          
FLINGS herself over the edge --                                      

ON BELLA SCREAMING with exhilaration as she plummets down,           
down... then SPLASHES into the water.

No sign of Bella. A beat. Suddenly, she POPS back up.
Inhales deeply -- and laughs!

<b>                           BELLA
</b>              Yes!

She enjoys a moment of elation and empowerment... then turns
to swim ashore... but her smile falters when she realizes
how strong the current is...

A WAVE crashes over her head. She gasps for breath.     Then         
ANOTHER WAVE hits her. Starts to pull her under...

UNDER THE WATER - Bella struggles --

ABOVE WATER - she pops up, looks around in a panic, SEES --

BELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE - something orange-ish,
bobbing on the surface of the water --

Bella goes down - then comes up again - THE ORANGE-ISH thing
is suddenly thirty yards closer.

Bella struggles to stay afloat but the current SMASHES her
into a rock, the air goes out of her chest. She sinks.

ANGLE ON THE ORANGE-ISH THING -- IT'S VICTORIA, floating
effortlessly, hungry anticipation on her face. She dips
below the surface, vanishing...
UNDER THE WATER - BELLA SINKS, struggling at first... Edward      
appears in front of her, his eyes full of longing and love.
He reaches to her, she to him, hands almost touching, things
going dark... suddenly A HAND GRABS HER COLLAR --

Jacob hits her on the back.   She spits up water, coming to.

She focuses, finally SEES Jacob hovering over her, relieved.
Behind him stands Sam.

<b>                          SAM
</b>              She'll be alright.

Sam looks out at the water, scanning it.   Sensing something.

Their faces are close... and stay close for an intimate
beat. They could kiss, their lips near... but Bella blinks
herself back to reality and pulls away.

reacts to a repugnant smell outside --

shut and starts the truck.

She flinches at the stinging remark. He disappears into the
darkness, leaving her alone on the dark road.

She's closer to her house than her truck. She hurries
forward. The NIGHT SOUNDS start to encroach, branches
crackling, bushes rustling. She glances behind her...
nothing but darkness... she faces forward again ---

And runs directly into a VAMPIRE! Bella SCREAMS -- then
realizes IT'S ALICE. Bella is stunned. So is Alice.

A dump, empty but for a table and chair. On the table lie        
THE PHOTOS that once lined Bella's walls. Edward stands in       
the center of the room, stock still, staring out at the          
rising sun. His face is as empty and desolate as Bella's         
was after he left.

A CELL PHONE on the table RINGS jarringly. He doesn't move.      
It continues. Finally, he whips the receiver to his ear,
exasperated.

<b>                            EDWARD

Rosalie, on the phone, stands at the picture window --

ROSALIE'S POV - EXT. ALASKAN HOUSE - Emmett, Jasper,
Carlisle and Esme walk away from the house, over the snow to     
the treeline, on their way to hunt. None wear coats.

                 Esme's a wreck, Carlisle never smiles.          
                 Even Emmett's depressed. You've

caught it, sits up.

Bella walks Charlie to his cruiser. He wears a dark, ill-
fitting funeral suit. At the car, Bella adjusts his tie --

              Leah's only a year older than you.
              And Seth's, what, fourteen...

Emotion threatens. She hugs him. He holds on a little too
tightly for a beat. Then he bucks up, climbs into his car.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>              There'll be a reception after. I
              might stay late, see if I can help.

Bella nods, then waves as he drives away. She turns to head
back inside but finds Alice suddenly at her side. She jumps.

<b>                          ALICE
</b>              You're not going?

Bella shrugs. Alice hears something, then looks down the          
road -- JACOB'S RABBIT appears in the distance....

<b>                          ALICE

              I'll go do some hunting.

ANGLE ON THE RABBIT -- as it pulls up. Jacob drives, Embry in
the passenger seat. Bella approaches, surprised to find QUIL
in the back; same short hair and hard look as the others.

<b>                          BELLA

Jacob enters behind Bella.   She turns to him...
<b>                          BELLA

<b>                          BELLA

Jacob turns, starts to leave. He looks back, sees her anger
turn to hurt. He stops. Beat.

He moves back to her, looks into her eyes with sadness.

<b>                           JACOB
</b>               Yeah, it does.

<b>                           BELLA
</b>               Am I gonna lose you this time, Jacob?

He can't answer that, but he presses his hand to her cheek.
<b>                           JACOB
</b>               It was easier when we were both human,

They look at one another, Jacob's hand still on her face,           
his eyes searching hers.

Slowly, he starts to bend toward her lips. She doesn't pull         
away. She misses him too much, needs him too badly. This            
time, she'll let it happen. A kiss is a centimeter away...          

Suddenly, the shrill RING of the phone makes them both jump.        
Jacob, the closest to it, doesn't move his face, just keeps         
looking into her eyes as he reaches for the phone, answers --

trembling in the way that precedes a wolf-morph.

                that I'm alive.

                He left you, Bella. He didn't want

<b>                            BELLA
</b>                But I still love him, and I'm not gonna
                let him kill himself out of guilt.
This wounds him. But she can't stop to soothe him.         She
pulls away and continues packing.

<b>                            JACOB
</b>                What about your dad?

Alice enters.

<b>                            ALICE
</b>                Got the airline tickets.

<b>                            JACOB
</b>                     (squaring off with Alice)
                You Cullens might hunt animals but
                those monsters in Italy don't.                          

<b>                            ALICE
</b>                I'm well aware what the Volturi are.
<b>                            JACOB
</b>                Then why are you taking Bella to them
                like a bottle of wine to a party?

<b>                            ALICE
</b>                Right, she's better off here with
                Victoria stalking her. The one you
                dogs can't seem to catch?

Jacob growls, a shudder ripping through him. Bella
intercedes, stopping him from morphing by grabbing Alice.

<b>                            BELLA
</b>                Let's go.

<b>EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Alice flies to her car. But Jacob catches Bella's arm, not
hostile. Just pleading.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              Please, Bella. Stay here.   For                      
              Charlie... for me.

Bella sees the love in his eyes; this could be last time she
ever sees him. She hugs him, then pulls away.

<b>                            BELLA
</b>              Bye, Jacob.

He watches, agonized as she races to the car, climbs in...
<b>INT. THE MERCEDES (CONTINUOUS) - DAY
</b>
Bella tries to pull on her seat belt but Alice stops her --

<b>                          ALICE
</b>              Maybe Jacob's right.                                 
                   (Bella tries to                                 
                    interrupt)                                     
              No. You need to realize - the Volturi                
              could easily see me as Edward's
              accomplice. And you're a human who
              knows too much and tastes too good.
              They could kill us all.

Bella's response is to yank her seat belt into its clip.           
Alice sees she won't change her mind. She shifts into gear         
and PEELS OUT. Bella looks out the window for Jacob; he's          
not there... she turns toward the woods --                         

BELLA'S POV -- THE TREELINE -- SHREDDED CLOTHING FLIES in the
air as we SEE the HIND LEGS OF A WOLF disappear into the
forest. Off Bella, fighting tears but determined as hell...        

<b>INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT                                  
</b>
ON EDWARD walking down a seemingly endless corridor.
Finally, he reaches a set of intricately carved double doors
which open for him. He enters --

<b>INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT
</b>
-- Edward finds himself facing three wooden thrones, on
which sit the ancient Volturi: Aro, Marcus, Caius.                 

Aro wears an expensive, contemporary, black Italian suit,          
long black hair in a loose ponytail to his waist.
<b>

Marcus and Caius eschew modern clothing for rich silk robes,
their long hair loose around them. All three have
translucent, onion-like, white skin.

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              Have you decided?

<b>                          ARO
</b>              It was an intriguing debate.     We don't
              get many suicidal vampires.

<b>                           CAIUS
</b>              Pathetic.

<b>                          ARO
</b>              I'm afraid your gifts are too valuable
              to destroy. But if you're unhappy
              with your lot, join us. We'd be
              delighted to utilize your skills.

<b>                          MARCUS
</b>              Not without cause.

Edward registers this, his face setting. Clearly, he's           
going to give them cause. He strides out. Off Aro...             

<b>                          ARO
</b>              Such a waste.

Bella waits impatiently at the curb as --                        

A YELLOW HARD-TOP PORSCHE with darkly tinted windows
SCREECHES to a halt in front of her. The passenger door          
opens - Alice is behind the wheel, pulling off the chic,         
white, hooded coat she used for protection against the sun.      
As Bella climbs in, buckles up --

Alice punches it as Bella SEES --
BELLA'S POV - A MEDIEVAL FORTIFIED VILLAGE atop a distant
hill. Volterra.

<b>EXT. VOLTERRA - DAY
</b>
The narrow, centuries-old streets are crowded with festival
revellers who all wear RED. They gaily head toward the town
square carrying red pendants, balloons, scarves. The
PORSCHE weaves through them, hurrying forward.

<b>INTERCUT INSIDE THE PORSCHE --

</b>              San Marcos Day festival. The perfect               
              setting. Large crowds. The Volturi                 
              won't let him get far enough to reveal             
              himself - he's counting on that.                   

<b>                          BELLA

Alice screeches to a halt at a ROAD BLOCK.   Italian POLICE      
wave her back. Bella jumps out --

Alice watches her go... then senses something, looks up --

</b>OVERCOAT leaps from building to building, tracking Bella.
As he disappears, off Alice --

<b>EXT. VOLTERRA ALLEYS - SERIES OF FAST CUTS - DAY

Bella races down the cobble-stoned alleys, stumbling on the
uneven stones. Festival revellers head in the same
direction, she maneuvers around them.

ABOVE BELLA - SEE flashes of the FIGURE IN THE OVERCOAT --

As Bella nears the square, the alleys become more populated.
She pushes past people AD LIBBING "excuse me," "sorry."
Finally, she emerges into --

<b>EXT. PALAZZO DEI PRIORI (CONTINUOUS) - DAY
</b>
BELLA'S POV - a sea of scarlet flags, dresses and jackets.
On the other side of the crowded square - THE CLOCK TOWER;
it reads one minute before noon.

Bella battles her way through the square; the crowd shoves
back, shouting at her in Italian --

<b>                          ITALIAN MAN

Bella charges forward to find herself blocked by --

A FOUNTAIN - Suddenly, GONG!    The clock tower bells chime.
It's noon!

Bella jumps into the fountain, wades through the shallow
water to the other side -- she jumps out and barrels through
the crowd. Finally, she SEES --

<b>BELLA'S POV - BENEATH THE CLOCK TOWER
</b>
Edward, in the shadows, just inches from the sunlight.

<b>                            BELLA

-- GONG! Bella's cry is drowned out by the BOOMING CHIME.
She pushes toward him, fighting to reach him as --

CLOSE ON EDWARD (IN SLOW MOTION) - as he unbuttons his
shirt, exposing his bare chest --

ON BELLA (IN SLOW MOTION) - calling his name --

ON EDWARD'S FACE - he closes his eyes, welcoming death --
then slowly --

Edward takes a step into the sunlight, the rays hitting his        
shoe, but before the sun touches his skin --                       

BELLA SLAMS into him - it's like running into a brick wall --      

<b>                            BELLA
</b>              No, Edward!    Don't!

Edward opens his eyes and looks at Bella as the clock booms
its final CHIME. He's amazed, already dead in his mind.

He suddenly kisses her, stepping back into the shade with
her. They soak each other in like starved people suddenly
nourished. He pulls away to look at her...

<b>                          EDWARD

<b>                          BELLA

They share a long look, he's about to kiss her again... when
suddenly, he stiffens -- and abruptly PUSHES Bella behind
him, taking a protective stance in front of her --

They face the DARK ALLEY that runs under the clock tower.
Out of the alley's shadows emerge --

TWO FIGURES IN HOODED OVERCOATS. Both stunningly handsome
males in their 20's: FELIX, huge, strong; and DEMETRI,             
slender, elegant. Both have unsettling burgundy red EYES.

<b>                          EDWARD

gracious of the two. But no less dangerous.

ALICE suddenly appears, lightly tripping through the alley       
toward them, pulling back the hood of her white swing coat.

A very tiny, young woman appears, JANE. She also wears a
dark overcoat, her Botticelli angel-like face peering out
from under the hood. SEE her CRIMSON IRISES.

Felix and Demetri are back off immediately. Edward and           
Alice step back, as well. Bella can see they're afraid of        
this small girl.

</b>              Follow me.

Jane simply turns and heads up the alley, confident they'll
follow. Felix, smirking, gestures for them to go ahead of
him. Edward takes Bella's hand...

<b>EXT. VOLTERRA STREETS - DAY
</b>
Jane leads Edward, Bella and Alice through several narrow,
dark alleys. Felix and Demetri bring up the rear. Edward
never loosens his grip on Bella's hand.

Their path dead ends at a WALL OF BRICK. Jane just strides
forward and, without breaking pace - drops down into an OPEN
HOLE in the street; it's a drain. Alice follows Jane.
Bella looks down, sees nothing but BLACKNESS.

</b>              It's alright. Alice will catch you.

Edward takes her wrists, dangles her over the hole --
<b>INT. SEWERS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY
</b>
-- ON BELLA as she drops through the darkness, to be caught
by Alice. Edward lands beside them, then Felix and Demetri.

Edward pulls Bella close as they follow Jane through the
sewer. He meets Bella's eyes, trying to look reassuring,
but he's tense as hell. Finally, they reach --

A FOLDING IRON ELEVATOR DOOR. Jane easily pulls it aside.
They all enter. As the door CLANGS shut on them --

They head through the lobby to --

they reach the carved double doors which open --

Bella, Edward and Alice enter to face the three ancients:
Aro, Marcus, Caius.

Eight VOLTURI GUARDS (including Jane, Felix, Demetri) line the

BELLA'S POV - THE FLOOR - there's a depression in the center
that leads to a drain. Bella shivers.

Aro rises, greets them like old friends, taking Edward's
hand and shaking it --

<b>                          ARO
</b>              What a happy surprise! Bella is alive
              after all. Isn't that wonderful?

Caius responds with a sour expression. Marcus could care           
less. Aro doesn't release Edward's hand, looks at him as --        

<b>                          ARO
</b>              Her blood appeals to you so much it

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              It's not without effort.

</b>                   (laughing)
              I can see that.

Off Bella's look, Edward explains --                               

<b>                          EDWARD

              Edward. Though... you can't read
              Bella's thoughts. Fascinating.

He releases Edward's hand and turns to Bella.
<b>                          ARO

He reaches for Bella's hand. She hesitates, does she have a        
choice? Aro laughs at her reluctance, further extends his          
hand. Bella finally takes it.                                      

A beat as he holds her hand... confusion sweeping over him.        

<b>                          ARO

He releases her, moves back to his chair, deep in thought.

Jane turns toward Bella but Edward springs in front of her --        

Jane instead focuses her gaze on Edward which FLINGS him             
across the room where he collapses, writhing in agony. Jane          
concentrates on him with a small smile, enjoying his pain.           
<b>                            BELLA

Bella and Alice rush to his side.    As soon as Jane looks
away, Edward's pain ceases.

</b>              Jane, dear.    The girl?                               

Jane's gaze now turns toward Bella who cringes, awaiting the         
pain... but nothing happens. Jane's grin is replaced by              
anger. Aro laughs like a child with a new toy.                       

Jane, infuriated, moves toward Bella, but Aro stops her with         
a tiny gesture.

              But that's not your intention, is it.

He nods to Felix who moves toward Bella, but he only takes a         
step before Edward tackles him.

Alice leaps to help but several Volturi guard hold her back,      
which is no easy job. As she struggles mightily --                

Edward is David to Felix's Goliath.    Edward will lose, but      
he'll go down fighting.                                           

-- Edward is fast, anticipating Felix's moves before he           
makes them, but Felix is stronger --                              

-- Felix grabs Edward, throws him into the ceiling, SMASHING      
against the marble; he drops like a stone. Is then                
immediately KICKED across the room.

But Aro ignores her, leans forward to study Edward.    Jane is    
itching to step in. Aro gestures her back.                        

-- Felix takes some hits, but then lifts Edward overhead,         
CRACKING him like a nut, then flinging him against a wall --      

Bella runs toward Aro but a Volturi Guard flings her away;        
she flies HARD against the wall.                                  

The guard is then occupied by the thrashing Alice --              

Bella, bruised, but not broken, makes another attempt to get      
to Aro -- finally reaches him, kneels in front of him --

He sees Bella kneeling in front of Aro.

Edward and Alice rush Bella out - PUSH IN ON BELLA'S                
TORMENTED FACE as the SCREAMING gets louder... and louder --

She catches her breath, disoriented, confused. Then she             
turns to find Edward lying beside her, looking at her.

Bella takes it stoically.    Emmett bounds over and lifts           
Bella into a bear hug.

              Sounds perfect.                                      

As she climbs in...                                                

<b>INT. EDWARD'S CAR - MORNING
</b>
Edward drives Bella home.    He is somber.   She is resigned.      

<b>                            EDWARD
</b>              When?
<b>                          BELLA
</b>              After graduation.                                    

<b>                          EDWARD                                   
</b>              Just two months.                                     

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              It'll be best for Dad that way. I can                
              pretend to be at college somewhere.                  
              Carlisle suggested it. But...                        
                   (quiet, emotional)                              
              I wish you'd be the one to change me.                

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>                   (beat)
              Would you be willing to trade for that?

<b>                         BELLA
</b>                   (hopeful)                                       
              Name it.

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              Five more years as a human.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              The Volturi won't wait that long.

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              I'll settle for three.                               

<b>                          BELLA
</b>                   (sadly, shakes her head)
              I won't risk it. It'll have to be
              Carlisle.

He takes her hand.

</b><b>                                                           114.
</b>


<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              Why are you so willing to give up your
              soul?

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              Because I don't believe you've lost
              yours. And I want to share mine with
              you forever.

He looks to her, kisses her hand... then suddenly Edward           
SLAMS on the brakes --

<b>THEIR POV - THE ROAD
</b>
-- Someone stands in the road directly in front of them --
it's JACOB. He glares, then turns and walks into the woods.
<b>                          BELLA
</b>              What is he doing?

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              He wants to talk to me.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              Well, he can talk to me first.

She pushes out of the car --

<b>INT. WOODS - MORNING
</b>
Edward and Bella tramp through the woods to FIND -- Jacob
leaning against a tree. His expression is hard.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              You're still alive.                                  

<b>                          BELLA                                    
</b>              I've been calling you.                               
<b>                          JACOB
</b>              Couldn't drop by?                                    

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              He thinks I'm keeping you away.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>                   (spinning on him)
              Stay the hell out of my head!

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              Dad grounded me, Jake. We're trying                  
              to get back before he wakes up.                      
<b>
</b><b>                                                           115.
</b>


Jacob doesn't buy it. Bella is frustrated. But Edward
takes a step toward Jacob. Calm. Diplomatic.

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              Jacob, I know you have something to
              say to me, but I'd like to say
              something first. Alright?

Jacob leans back against the tree, arms folded, waiting.

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>                   (sincere)
              Thank you. For keeping Bella alive
              when I... didn't.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              No, you didn't. And it wasn't for
              your benefit, trust me.

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              I know. I'm still grateful.
                   (then)
              But I'm back now. And I'm not leaving
              Bella's side till she orders me away.

She looks at him. He returns the look. Jacob sees the              
devotion between them. It wounds him. But he masks it.

<b>                           JACOB
</b>              We'll see.

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              Either way, we'll handle Victoria from
              here on out.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              She's been laying low. Ever since
              your freaky sister showed up. Guess
              she can't stand you Cullens either.

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              She'll come back.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              She does, she's ours.   She killed on
              our turf.

<b>                           EDWARD
</b>              We'll see.

<b>                          JACOB                                    
</b>              My turn to talk. I'm here to remind
              you about a key point in the Treaty.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          116.

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>                   (reads his thoughts, nods)
              I haven't forgotten.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              Good.

<b>                           BELLA
</b>              What?   What key point?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              If any of them bites a human, the
              truce is over. That's bite, not kill.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>                   (realizing)
              But... if I choose it, it's none of
              your business.

Jacob is horrified, starting to shake with rage.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              If you... what!? No.      No way.   I
              won't let you --

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              -- Bella, step back --

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              You're not gonna be one of them.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              That's not your call --

<b>                          JACOB
</b>                   (even more intense)
              You know what we'll do to you - I
              won't have a choice --
<b>                          EDWARD
</b>              We're done here --

Edward takes Bella's arm, starts to pull her away.    Jacob
lunges, trying to extract Bella from him --

<b>                          JACOB
</b>              You don't speak for her!

Edward PUSHES Jacob away; he flies back ten feet in the air,
but mid-air he PHASES INTO A WOLF!
<b>
</b><b>                                                         117.
</b>


-- The Jacob-wolf lands on all fours, spinning to face
Edward in an attack stance. Edward shifts stance, as well,
readying for a fight --

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              Stop!

Edward and Jacob circle one another, seconds from lunging --

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>                   (to Bella)
              Get out of here. Now!

But Bella races between them, forceful, insistent.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>                   (to both of them)
              You do this, you'll be going through me.

A long tense beat, none of them backing down - it could go
either way --

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              I swear to God, I'm not moving.

Both rivals see she's dead serious. Edward backs off, ever-
so-slightly... the Jacob-wolf does the same.                     

<b>                          BELLA
</b>                   (turning to Edward)
              Give me a second. Please.

Edward shakes his head.   Doesn't move an inch.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              Read his thoughts.   Is he going to                
              hurt me?
Edward does, and finally, reluctantly backs away. But his        
eyes never leave the wolf's. They glare at one another.

Bella carefully approaches the Jacob-wolf, blocking his line
of sight. Her voice is kind, pleading.

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              Jacob, I love you. You're my best
              friend. But... I can't change how I
              feel. Please don't make me choose.
                   (quietly, emotionally)
              Because it'll be him. It's always
              been him.
<b>

</b>


Anguish sweeps through the wolf's fierce face.    It's even
harder to take than when he's in human form --

<b>                          BELLA
</b>              But you know how important you are to --

Suddenly, the wolf BOLTS out of there...

ON BELLA - fighting tears as she watches him disappear...

<b>                          BELLA (V.O.)
</b>              There were problems ahead.     Seemingly             
              insurmountable...                                    

Edward's arms wrap around her from behind.                         
<b>                          BELLA (V.O.)
</b>              ... If I didn't become a vampire, the
              Volturi would kill me. If I did, my
              best friend would do the job himself,
              or get killed in the attempt.

She turns to face Edward, looking into his loving eyes...

<b>                          BELLA (V.O.)
</b>              Victoria was still on the loose,
              putting everyone I loved in danger...

He kisses her tenderly, washing away her concerns.

<b>                          BELLA (V.O.)
</b>              But I'd already survived the worst --
              losing Edward. So I knew I could
              survive anything...

<b>                           EDWARD                                  
</b>              I'm here.   Always.
And she sees that's the truth, believes it. He takes her
hand and together they turn, heading out of the woods...

<b>                          BELLA (V.O.)
</b>              And soon, I'd be like him. We'd face
              our fate together. Forever.

Off them, hand in hand, inseparable... as we begin to --
